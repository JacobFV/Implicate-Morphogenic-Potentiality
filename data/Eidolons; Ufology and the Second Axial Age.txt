children we are in a sense clouds of possibility which contain all the possible forms which we could eventually come to take all of the Futures which we could possibly live out all of the beliefs which we could possibly hold and habits which we could possibly develop we are a kind of clay as it were which will eventually come to be sculpted and hardened by the Kiln that is the life world which we will be required to navigate and Orient ourselves towards as we mature maturation conversely can be understood as a process of solidification and delimitation as our youth plays itself out decisions are made habits are formed and beliefs become engraved within our minds the diffuse nebulous clouds of possibility which we were as children come to be chiseled down into definite patterns of behav Behavior patterns of thought conceptions of what we believe ourselves to be and expectations about the world time itself is at least in one of its various aspects a process by which distributions of possibility collapse into definite moments of actuality each moment of actuality has a definition and determinacy which potentiality lack the specificity of a decision which is cut into the possible so as to carve out the actual in another sense time can also be understood as the inertia or momentum of that which has achieved such determinate rigidity solid things are those which resist transformation objects in motion will stay in motion unless the determinance of that motion comes into conflict with the determinacy of another object's motion through Collision in other words the actualities which are carved out of potentiality by the processions of time strive to maintain their structure this ontological inertia is a crucial condition for the possibility of biological life and human life in particular biological morphology depends upon the fact that atoms and molecules behave in more or less predictable ways complex super structures depend upon stable and reliable substructures castles and temples can be erected upon Stone but not upon mud then is Italy not withstanding likewise human life worlds and individual human beings require a psychological and ethological substructure which is also more or less stable fixed and therefore predictable in order to facilitate the flourishing of human existence human societies are much better able to sustain and further themselves when the processes of life are repetitive and therefore reliable repetition might seem uninteresting but rapid and unpredictable change can be immensely catastrophic societies which manage to survive and thrive are therefore always societies which to varying degrees emphasize Conformity with regards to certain practices social norms beliefs art forms and ideals within the individuation process of the individual human psyche such a conservativism can also be seen to take hold as individuals mature from adolescence into adulthood the habits beliefs and expectations which we develop throughout the maturation process come to rigidify often becoming highly resistant to transformation teaching Old Dogs new tricks isn't easy and human beings aren't all that different the human psyche needs to be constituted by stable structures which condition a stable relationship to the world under most circumstances when such stable structures come to break down the can be experienced as intense anxiety paranoia or pain looking at these Dynamics in an archetypal manner we can see that within the collective unconscious these processes of concretion solidification stabilization and inertia are represented by the figure of Saturn or Kronos within helenic mythology hesiod and ID speak of a golden age of Saturn a time before the development of human civilization in which human beings lived in a state of harmonious Unity with the natural world a time before human civilization had divided itself from nature through Transformations brought about by technology architecture and social complexification the valorization of Saturn seems quite sensible from the perspective of pre-modern cultures unexpected rap rapid change would have typically been cataclysmic for premodern societies drastic transformations of social structures or environmental conditions would have been devastating for agrarian peoples whose lives depended upon the regular processions of natural cycles when the present was like the past that typically conditioned peace growth and abundance when the present ruptured the patterns which had previously held fast this typically conditioned starvation war and social upheavals and yet the inertia of time can itself be a pathologically constrictive limiting and suffocating Force blind adherence to the habits and Norms of the past will always fail to Accord with the Relentless evolutionary flux of Nature and as human societies themselves came to transform over the course of ancient history the COS ologies of human cultures increasingly came to resituate this saturnian power in relation to other archetypal personas when we look to the various mythical cosmologies of human cultures throughout time and space we can see that one of the most significant features which distinguish such world conceptions is the nature of the deities which are regarded as most Central Within These cosmologies the Golden Age of hesiod and ID refers to a human life world within which the saturnian archetype was regarded as Central as the grandfather King of the Gods this centrality correlates with an apex placement within an implied hierarchy of values deities are themselves in a sense values they are forces of nature which human beings believe they must bring themselves into accordance with which they must cultivate and facilitate in order to ensure prosperity and survival the cosmological centrality of Saturn thus implies a life world in which saturnian conservatism was regarded as the central value which all other values were oriented in relation to ensuring that the present remained in accordance with the past was understood as the highest concern of such peoples yet human societies and human consciousness came to evolve and through this process Saturn came to be almost universally displaced by the Jovian archetype Zeus Jupiter peras and Vishnu sedentary agrarian civilization certainly required stability but even more fundamentally it relied upon growth abundance wealth and prosperity the characteristics of of the archetypal monarchical father rather than grandfather we can see this transformation play out within for example the evolution of burial practices within Neolithic archaeological sites such as Jericho and Cal hoyak we find no specialized locations for the resting places of dead bodies separately from the world of the living the dead were instead buried near houses or even under the floors of houses themselves eles beneath fireplaces or beds for example these Neolithic peoples also retain the skulls of certain deceased ancestors skulls which were covered in plaster which was then decorated with paint and shells to depict facial features although these practices might seem to us as bizarre or even perverse what these practices represent is the fact that for such Neolithic peoples there was not yet any clear demarcation between the world of the living and the world of the Dead the past remained very much present and attending to the needs of the Dead through offerings is of fundamental significance within societies which are characterized by such ancestor worship as we can see in extent cultures which retain similar practices it is not until near the end of the Neolithic period around 3000 BC that we see the first organized burial site which clearly delineates the resting places of the Dead from the world of the living one of the earliest known examples of such a true cemetery is the caramico cemetery of what is today modern Athens we can understand the caramico cemetery as an early representation of a Greek Spirit which would definitively Center itself within the realm of waking Jovian present oriented Consciousness and away from the dreamlike saturnian and past oriented consciousness of the Neolithic within which the present was not yet clearly disentangled from the demands of the past and of the Dead similarly we can see that in ancient Mesopotamia complex rituals had come to develop which were intended to ensure that the dead did not reemerge within the world of the living as Phantoms while Neolithic practices seem to be oriented towards maintaining the Pres of the Dead within the world of the living Mesopotamian civilization had come to instead Orient its practices specifically towards ensuring that the dead remained in the other world and out of the Living World As We would expect throughout the development of Mesopotamian civilization we also see a gradual supplanting of the saturnian deity enl by the Jovian deity Marduk the most striking expression of the saturnian phase of human consciousness is seen within the practice of child sacrifice typically this practice was conducted in times of intense hardship or cataclysm that is times of rapid and unexpected change and involve the ritualized execution of a male child the solar future being offered to appease the saturnian past and thereby ensure a return to stability and normaly numerous accounts of such practices can be found throughout ancient texts all of which explicitly correlate these sacrifices with the worship of Saturn Plato tells us quote with us for instance Human Sacrifice is not legal but Unholy whereas the carthaginians perform it as a thing they account wholly and legal and that too when some of them sacrifice even their own Sons to Kronos as I dare say you yourself have heard another account can be found in the writings of Pho of BIOS quote among ancient peoples in critically dangerous situations it was customary for the rulers of a city or Nation rather than lose everyone to provide the dearest of their children as a propitiatory sacrifice to the avenging deities the children thus given up were slaughtered according to a secret ritual now Kronos whom the Phoenicians call L who was in their land and who was later divinized after his death as the star of Kronos had an only son by a local Bride named anab even now among the Phoenicians the only son is given this name when War's gravest dangers gripped the land Kronos dressed his son in Royal attire prepared an altar and sacrificed him end quote tertullian likewise tells us that such practices survived within certain North African cultures even to late Antiquity quote in Africa infants used to be sacrificed to Saturn and quite openly down to the proc Consulate of tiberias who Took the priests themselves and on the very trees of their Temple under whose Shadow their crimes had been committed hung them alive like votive offerings on Cross es to this day that Holy crime persists in secret end quote despite the near Universal transformation of cosmologies and values which came to exalt Jupiter rather than Kronos as the chief deity some societies nonetheless maintained the centrality of saturnian inertia and conservatism within the ancient Mediterranean world the vestiges of this saturnian past were maintained most most strikingly by The Phoenician peoples within the Hebrew Bible the Israelites are commanded not to enact the child sacrifice rituals which were still practiced by the Canaanites a Phoenician culture similarly the ancient Romans condemned the carthaginians another Phoenician culture for continuing this practice of ritual sacrifice the Punic Wars and Hebrew conquest of Canaan can thus be seen as conflicts within which Mediterranean cultures took a definitive stand against the saturnian culture forms which had previously dominated the region the future would no longer be sacrificed to the demands of the past and the realm of the Dead would come to be regarded as a dark Abode of twittering Souls which was to be definitively distinguished from the realm of the living Saturn would no longer be allowed to devour his children without a fight in polar contrast with the archetype of saturnian concreteness and inertia stands the archetype of combustion metamorphosis rupture Liberation and unexpected upheavals within modern astrological scholarship this archetype has been identified as that embodied by the planet Uranus Uranus is the jester the coyote Prometheus Anansi the spider and The Monkey King Sun wuk Kong as saturnian Dynamics solidify and perpetuate rigid foundational structures of Institutions Norms architectural edifices and traditional practices Uranian Dynamics are those by which tensions contradictions or imbalances are released or resolved through explosive transformation within the works of Carl Yung we can see this Uranian archetype identified as the archetypal trickster a figure which in various forms of manifestation comes to appear within the worlds of myths dreams superordinary experiences and autobiographical narratives moreover Yung saw that manifestations of the trickster tend to perform certain specific roles Within These narratives as we have already examined the human psyche tends to solidify in many ways through the process of maturation the formless indeterminacy and plasticity of adolescence comes to rigidify into stable patterns of thought belief and behavior such that the individual human being comes to assume a stable orientation towards the world which it must navigate yet such solidification can itself become detrimental to the process of individuation the achievement of stable patterns is not itself the goal of human psychological development but rather only one mode of activity by which the human organism comes to realize itself within the more encompassing process of individuation the process by which the psyche strives to transform itself so as to actualize the self ideal or Soul which serves as the center of Developmental gravity within the human psyche as such rigid structures of belief expectation behavior and thought can come to be barriers to the process of individuation these barriers serve to secure stabilize and therefore protect the human organism and therefore the human ego often comes to identify itself with these rigid structures we come to believe ourselves to actually be the patterns which have come to form within us and thus our egos tend to become highly resistant to transformations of these structures the breakdown of these structures is a process which we find to be immensely unsettling anxiety inducing and even traumatic and therefore such transformation is a process which the human ego very rarely undertakes of its own volition it is here then that we see the psychical role which comes to be played by the Uranian trick archetype the trickster subverts expectations uses humor to deflate that which is overly severe or stoic and in general acts to shatter the solid architectures formed by the processes of saturnian concretion so as to reintroduce liquidity or plasticity which can then come to be reformed in accordance with the furthering of the individuation process looking back to the Punic Wars and the Israel conquest of the Canaanites we can see that these conflicts both occurred during the final centuries before the Common Era historians placed the Israelite conquest of Canaan around the 2 or 1 centuries BC while the Punic Wars took place between 264 and 146 BC the city of Rome is believed to have been founded sometime during the 8th Century BC thus beginning The Narrative Arc which would culminate in the Punic Wars looking back from the Israelite conquest of Canaan we can trace the origins of the Israelite peoples back to the 9th century BC although the exact historical origins of the Israelite peoples remain subject of debate among Scholars with these time frames in mind we can then see that the narrative arcs of the Roman and Israelite peoples culminating in the Canaanite and Punic Wars approximately correlate with what the German philosopher and psychiatrist Carl yaspers referred to as the axial age which which yasper places between the 9th and 4th centuries BC the axial age was a period in which various novel forms of human religiosity came to develop which were distinctly universalistic in character this axial age saw the birth of Chinese Daoism presocratic and platonic philosophy in Greece Buddhism in India Zoroastrianism in Persia and many other forms of spirituality which radically departed from the tribalistic or nationalistic forms of spirituality which had prevailed throughout most human cultures up to that point previously dominant forms of spirituality tended to be rooted in the tribal National or ethnic identity of human beings Gods tended to be associated with a particular tribe or nation and there was very little indication of a sense of human spirituality as a un Universal which transcended such parochial distinctions axial age religions conversely tended to regard the human subject as a transcendental category and therefore for developed forms of spirituality which pertain to human existence as such rather than to the members of particular groups once again we can see this transformation as one in which the continuity and conservatism of the past are subverted by by novel developments of human consciousness this transformation of spirituality was one through which the blood in one's veins quite literally one's inheritance from The ancestral past came to be regarded as less fundamental to one's spiritual Constitution than one's Consciousness as such within the Israelite Canaanite Wars and the Punic Wars we seem to see conflicts within which the last vestiges of purely saturnian culture forms made their final stand against the cultures which would come to shape the future of human civilization given that we can clearly see the polar dynamism of Saturn and Uranus Within These narrative currents one would expect to find manifestations of the Uranian trickster archetype Within These histories and that is precisely what we find within the mythological history of the Israelite peoples of course we see numer nous accounts of supernormal encounters with Spiritual Beings perhaps most strikingly among them being the depictions of seraphim cherubim and ofanim found in the books of Isaiah and Ezekiel similarly the Roman historian livie tells us that prior to the outbreak of the Punic Wars the Roman people experienced a plethora of supernormal phenomena and Omens animals gave birth to deformed or two-headed Offspring wolves were seen wandering the streets of the city sacred fires burned with unnatural brightness and statues of deities were seen to shed tears of blood meteor showers and other unusual Celestial phenomena were seen in the sky what these various supernormal occurrences seem to represent I would argue are manifestations of processes through which the collective psyche of humanity was coming to a climax in it Breakaway from the Saturn Centric cultures and cosmologies of previous epochs with this understanding of the interplay of saturnian and Uranian psychical processes in mind we will next be using this understanding to address a modern form of supernormal phenomena which has recently seen an intense Resurgence of popular interest a phenomenon which has come to be variously known as the alien UFO or UAP phenomenon all right guys so before moving forward with this I do want to make a quick announcement so last month we started a kind of trial run for hosting a couple of webinar courses through our new website forscore and it has been a blast on Sundays we have been doing Jean gers the ever present origin and on Saturdays we have been going through Alfred North Whitehead's process and reality and those have been great so beginning on May 4th we're going to be starting four new webinar courses as well and we're going to be beginning the philosophy of Freedom by Rudolph Steiner we're going to be doing the phenomenon of Man by tar dardan we're going to be doing the question concerning technology and other essays by Martin heiger and we're going to be doing the reflexive Universe by Arthur M young so if you guys might be interested in that you should totally check out our website we will have a link in the description of course as well as on the main Channel page and the general idea here is to address topics authors thinkers ideas which are really interesting and really important but which you're probably not going to come across very much within standard academic education within a university or or Community College or anything like that so I really want to try and make these ideas accessible to people and so that's what we're trying to do here if you're interested in that you should totally check it out if you want to sign up for the classes one session at a time you can do that and see whether you like it or not if you like to sign up for the entire class then you can do that as well and you'll get a $20 off discount for that so with no further Ado back to the video thanks guys although we can see numerous precursors of the UFO phenomenon which extend well into the early modern medieval and even classical eras it was during the mid 20th century that the UFO phenomenon truly came to prominence as a significant focus of widespread interest following World War II UFO encounters came to be increasingly widespread between 1947 and 1969 project Bluebook accounted some 12,000 UFO events in the United States alone between the years 2000 and 2023 the National UFO Reporting Center received over 112,000 UFO sighting reports rep s given the sheer ubiquity of UFO encounters many professional and amateur researchers have attempted to investigate the phenomenon over the course of the many decades which have elapsed since reports of these occurrences Rose to prominence within popular awareness throughout much of the 20th century two primary theories held sway as to the nature of the entities which were said to have been encountered during these events the first Theory held that these occurrences could be explained in terms of secretive terrestrial Aerospace Technologies it was speculated that military agencies of the United States or other powerful State bureaucracies had developed Advanced Technologies such as anti-gravity or electromagnetic propulsion Technologies and that UFO sightings were actually reports of encounters with the experimental Aerospace Vehicles which had been secretively developed through the implementation of such Technologies the second theory proposed that these sightings were in fact encounters with extraterrestrial or even hyper terrestrial beings non-human biological organisms which had come to Earth from elsewhere in the cosmos or which resided unseen within the deep ocean or even in underground habitations the problem with both of these theories however is that both possibilities required that investigators ignore enormous amounts of evidence which suggested that the phenomenon was in fact much Stranger Than either Theory would imply Carl Yung himself weighed in on this issue stating quote in spite of all observations I know of there is no certainty about their very nature on the other side there is an overwhelming material pointing to their legendary or mythological aspect as a matter of matter of fact the psychological aspect is so impressive that one almost must regret that the UFOs seem to be real after all I followed up the literature as much as possible and it looks to me as if something were seen and even confirmed by radar but nobody knows exactly what is seen end quote as young observes in the above quotation the UFO phenomenon seems to pose us with a paradox on the one hand the phenomenon seems to express many characteristics which we would associate with definitively physical entities objects are reported to be seen by multiple Witnesses simultaneously aerial objects are reportedly detected by radar some instances involve reports of debris or other physical artifacts being left behind following the events and some reports even claim physical injuries to have been incurred by Witnesses these facts would seem to lend Credence to technological explanations of the phenomenon yet simultaneously many such instances if not most also Express characteristics which seem to be definitively mythical surreal psychological or even simply absurd although some ufologists have preferred to dismiss these features as simply being artifacts of human misperception or psychological Frailty some of the the most serious and scientifically rigorous researchers who have addressed the UFO phenomenon have found themselves forced to take such accounts quite seriously and as such to disqualify purely technological explanations of the phenomenon beginning in the 1960s the American astrophysicist Joseph Allen heinik and the French astronomer and computer scientist jacqu valet pioneered the scientific study of the UFO phenomen on unlike many amateur ufologists and enthusiasts heinik and valet were both professional academics who aspired to initiate a serious and rigorous scientific investigation into the nature of the UFO phenomenon and the research they would conduct over the course of their decades long ufology careers would prove to be immensely influential in both destigmatizing the field of ufology itself as well as providing invaluable insights and data pertaining to UFO encounters for numerous reasons both valet and heinik would come to abandon purely technological theories whether terrestrial or extraterrestrial as legitimately plausible explanations for the UFO phenomenon although such explanations resonated most intensely with the popular imagination of the 20th century an imagination which had recently come to be deeply influenced by both science fiction media as well as very real advances in Aerospace Technologies heinik and valet found that upon examining the actual patterns found within accounts of UFO encounters these technological explanations simply could not Accord with the actual phenomenon to be explained in 1973 heinik stated quote a few good sightings a year over the world would bolster the Extraterrestrial hypothesis but many thousands every year from remote regions of space and to what purpose to scare us by stopping cars and disturbing animals and puzzling us with their seemingly pointless Antics end quote in theorizing about what might actually be able to explain the evidence at hand heinik would come to make reference to the Hermetic notion of the astral plane thus suggesting the possibility that the UFO phenomenon might originate from non-corporeal constituents of the world heinik would also compare UFO encounters with Poltergeist phenomena and would emphasize patterns of correlation between UFO encounters and paranormal or Paras pychological occurrences valet would similarly note the strikingly super normal qualities which UFO reports tended to be characterized by and he would go on to extend his study to include account of supernormal experiences which had occurred before the Advent of 20th century Aerospace Technologies in doing so valet seemed to find repetitions of what appeared to be the exact same phenomenon occurring over the course of many centuries although these encounters seem to share in the same fundamental morphology as experiences the entities encountered within such experiences seem to be of a distinctly mercurial protein nature altering their presentation in accordance with the state of the popular imagination which prevailed within a given historical Zeitgeist the anomalous entities encountered during the early 20th century prior to the development of heavier than air flight Technologies appeared within Zeppelins while those encountered during the 19th or 18th centuries appeared within hot air balloons such entities often claim to hail from the planets Venus or Mars until astronomers came to see that those planets were inhospitable to human life following such discoveries anomalous entities instead began claiming to have arrived from distant solar systems tracing these patterns even further into the past valet came to see that within the premodern world such encounters involved entities which were identified as fairies Angels Jin or Elemental being such as nymphs sils or gnomes given the patently psychical and mythical nature of such encounters it may be tempting to Simply regard these accounts as folktales rather than genuine experiences in reality however such an explanation is no more in accordance with the evidence at hand than the previously addressed technological theories as previously noted just as frequently as we find traces of mythical and psychical aspects Within these phenomena we also find the signatures of physicality and Inter subjectivity one researcher who has drawn attention to the patently physical attributes of UFO occurrences has been Stanford University biologist Gary Nolan much like valet and heinik Dr Nolan's immensely substantial academic resume stands in rather stark contrast with the stereotypical character of the typical ufologist as an Ecentric amateur Nolan holds some 300 research articles and 40 United States patents to his name and his research has received funding from eight major biotechnology companies one notable research initiative which Nolan has undertaken within the field of ufology has been the isotopic analysis of metallic debris materials which have been recovered from alleged UFO encounters each species of atom can be found in a number of possible variations a s or Isotopes which possess the same number of electrons and protons and thus the same physical and chemical properties in most regards but a different number of neutrons out of approximately a dozen alleged debris samples Nolan's analysis found that two of those samples consisted of isotope distributions which are not found in nature as far as we know the isotope distributions found in these Metals could only have been created through a very intentional and highly expensive industrial process moreover there are no known technological reasons why these isotope ratios would be desirable at all different isotopes are sometimes radioactive and such radioactivity can play a crucial role in certain Technologies such as nuclear radiographic and radiometric devices stable isotopes however tend to behave in the exact same manner for technological purpose purposes therefore if these debris materials do indeed derive from some physical craft then whatever Technologies made use of such artificial isotope ratios must be Technologies which are unknown to the general public and mainstream science numerous accounts of UFO experiences also involve detection by radar systems as well as multiple simultaneous visual sightings of the same phenomenon including visual confirmations by highly trained and credible military personnel occurrences which certainly should not be so consistently documented if the UFO phenomenon was simply a matter of folkloric tales urban legends or misidentifications of mundane military aircraft one could of course argue that all the physical evidence can be accounted for in terms of hoaxes or state sponsored misinformation campaigns possibilities which are certainly the case in at least some instances but given the sheer volume and diversity of such Accounts at this point an attempt to explain the physicality of the UFO phenomenon in terms of hoaxes and misinformation would require postulating a preposterously Titanic Global conspiracy which would take us well outside the bounds of what seems genuinely plausible in January 2024 the philosopher and computer science scientist Bernardo castrop published an article titled uaps and nonhuman intelligence in an attempt to address the seemingly self-contradictory nature of the UFO phenomenon which appears to somehow be equal parts folklore supernormal psychology and supernormal Aerospace technology following young heinik and valet castrop addresses quite rightly the psychical and folklor nature of the phenomenon while also addressing the physical aspects which have likewise become increasingly difficult to Simply dismiss castrop writes quote the phenomenon does not seem to make any distinction between physical and psychological effects it produces both as if they were mere facets of one and the same causitive mechanism the boundaries we draw between the mental and the physical don't seem to be observed by the phenomenon which transits casually back and forth across the dividing line the phenomenon can be filmed tracked by radar and other sensors can emit measurable energy and often leaves physical Footprints and vestages behind but at least part of what the witnesses experience is staged the UAP sometimes evokes archetypal symbolic imagery directly in the witness's mind to to convey a feeling Laden metaphorical message end quote yet despite his explicit acknowledgement of the evidently dual nature of UFOs castrop nonetheless ultimately concludes that accounting for the UFO experience will require us to conjecture two distinct types of phenomena castrip contends that we must distinguish between nuts and bolts UFO entities those which seem to be instances of Advanced Aerospace Technologies and high strangeness occurrences those that seem to be of a strictly psychical and mythical nature castrip argues that while the high strangeness occurrences are to be addressed through the Frameworks of yungi and psychodynamic theories the nuts and bolts occurrences require an explanation in terms of some form of nonhuman intelligence the behaviors of observed UFOs imply that these hypothetical Technologies are far beyond what is within the reach of mainstream academic physics and as such it seems unlikely that even secretive governmental black projects would be capable of creating craft which could explain these occurrences unless very drastic advancements in theoretical physics were being systematically concealed by these alleged black projects castrip argues that it is highly unlikely that governmental organizations could be concealing novel advancements of physics while also using such advancements to engineer UFO Technologies castrip doesn't really present any argument in favor of his claim that such secretive advancements of physics are unlikely but it seems to me that castri finds this claim to be almost obvious because he clearly has far more faith in academic physics than I do and thus feels justified in assuming that if such advancements were indeed Within Reach then they would have been discovered CED by researchers working outside of the alleged black projects due to institutional financial and ideological characteristics of modern academic physics I don't find such reasoning to be terribly compelling but that will have to be a story for future videos castrip ultimately leans into a synthesis of the saluan hypothesis and ultraterrestrial hypothesis in order to explain the nuts and bolts UFO occurrences which he contends cannot be explained in a strictly psychical manner the ultraterrestrial hypothesis so dubbed by physicist and parapsychologist Dr Hal put off conjectures that UFO occurrences are in fact encounters with non-human intelligent beings which are not extraterrestrial but which rather reside alongside human beings here on the planet Earth albeit in almost total secrecy in order to Accord with the conspic lack of archaeological evidence for the existence of such a non-human terrestrial civilization castrip invokes the saluran hypothesis the conjecture that given the sheer immensity of geological time it is possible that a non-human civilization may have passed through its phases of industrialization so much earlier in geological time that all evidence of such development has been eroded and thus obfuscated by the natur natural processions of geological processes such a civilization having undergone industrialization many ttin if not hundreds of thousands of years ago within the prehistoric past may have then resituated itself beneath the earth's oceans in its later stages of development thereby concealing itself from Human observation if we are to take such an explanation seriously we must of course then ask how we might explain the consistent Crossing of these alleged boundaries between the physical and non-physical aspects of the phenomenon why does it seem that occurrences with patently physical qualities also tend to have patently psychical qualities and why do occurrences with psychical dreamlike qualities tend to also leave us with traces of physical evidence as for the high strangeness encounters castrop argues that in such instances physical traces can usually be explained in other ways than the encountered entities themselves being physical beings as for why the nuts and bolts entities tend to also be accompanied by seemingly parasal or paranormal phenomena as well castrip conjectures that the ultraterrestrials responsible for the nuts and bolts UFOs might be using Technologies which involve direct communication with human consciousness as communication via more ordinary language might not be possible between our two species in other words castrip claims that the high strangeness occurrences and nuts and bolts occurrences can be cleanly separated into two separate categories representing two distinct phenomena and that The Uncanny similarities between the two categories are ultimately just a matter of coincidence the commun communication methods used by the ultraterrestrials tend to appear to us as very similar to the purely psychical occurrences but ultimately the similarity is due to the nature of the human mind and not an indication of any identity between these allegedly separate types of events the problem with Castro's claim here that UFO occurrences can be divided into two distinct categories is that he essentially just asserts that this is the the case the researchers who actually produced the relevant data pertaining to these events did not conclude that such a division was actually warranted by the data jacqu valet is rather clear that the actual evidence rather clearly points to the UFO phenomenon being both physical and psychical rather than being two distinct phenomena although Joseph Allen heinik did proposed that the UFO phenomenon might indeed be constituted by a number of distinct phenomena he also ultimately came to conclude that the blurring of boundaries between the physical and the mental was a very real aspect of UFO occurrences Bernardo castrop therefore is not making this claim because the evidence itself is actually suggestive of two distinct phenomena he is making this claim because it would be very convenient for us if it were actually true if there were indeed two distinct phenomena which studiously adhered to boundaries between the physical and the psychological then this would leave the UFO phenomenon much more susceptible to explanations which Accord with the categorical boundaries which we generally assume should not be easily violated if that were the case we might nonetheless be forced to consider explanations that extend far beyond the bounds of modern scientific doctrines we might still need to posit hyper terrestrials or anti-gravity devices for example but to despite how seemingly outlandish such explanations might be these would nonetheless be explanations which respect the ontological boundaries which we assume to be impermeable due to our most basic metaphysical assumptions about the nature of the world in general if we actually face the evidence as it actually stands however we are forced to conclude that we are contending not with two distinct phenomena but rather with a single phenomenon or an array of phenomena which does not respect our preconceived ontological boundaries if we are willing to discard the two category hypothesis on account of the actual evidence then we find ourselves limited to possible explanations which are far more uncanny than even ultraterrestrials or anti-gravity engines over the course of his career jacqu valet came to see that the uncanniness of the UFO phenomenon did not seem to be simply a matter of our inability to produce plausible explanations but rather that uncanniness and even sheer absurdity seem to actually be core features of the UFO phenomenon itself valet has come to suggest that the UFO phenomenon seems to be almost intentionally absurd as though the Defiance of our expectations were itself a key aspect of the very function of the phenomenon in other words valet seems to have concluded that the UFO phenomenon is the archetypal trickster Uranus Prometheus Anansi coyote the jester manifestations of the psychical process by which rigid saturnian boundaries are defied and ruptured As We examined previously the activities of these Uranian phenomena are oriented specifically towards the breakdown of structures which the human ego has come to identify itself with the human ego experiences these solidified structures of beliefs expectations behaviors and indeed theoretical or metaphysical presuppositions as protective structures which facilitate the self security and stability of the human organism yet the human psyches primary directive as Carl Young has shown us is the individuation process a process which necessitates psychical Evolution and thus Transformations which rigid saturnian structures tend to Forstall as the ego itself is typically unwilling to break down its own defensive edifices in order to further its own development the archetypal trickster comes into play presenting the ego with experiences which defy expectations and break down solidified presumptions through uncanniness absurdity shock and awe the UFO phenomenon thus defies the boundaries of whatever rational explanations we might try to impose upon it precisely because the Defiance of such rigid structures simply is the psychological function of the UFO phenomenon itself the UFO phenomenon cannot be captured by explanations which Accord with our prevailing Notions of what rational explanations must be like because the breakdown of such prevailing Notions of rationality is the function of the phenomenon as valet correctly observes although the UFO phenomenon might be a uniquely modern form of this process it is nonetheless a continuation of a type of phenomenon which we can see extended throughout all of recorded human history regarding reported UFO Abduction cases valet tells us quote the symbolic display seen by the abductees is identical to the type of initiation ritual or astral voyage that is embedded in the occult traditions of every culture the structure of abduction stories is identical to that of occult initiation rituals the US o beings of today belong to the same class of manifestation as the occult entities that were described in centuries Past end quote when we look to traditional cultures we can see that the ritualistic initiatives described above by valet serve a very specific and very crucial role in the development of the individual human psyche and relation to Human Social organization within such initi iations we can see that the trickster archetype serves to destabilize the boundaries between self and other which come to develop through the human psychical maturation process through such initiations this D stabilization or deterritorialization serves to facilitate what anthropologists refer to as states of liminality states of inbetweenness plasticity and permeability which allow the initiate to be broken down and reconstructed and thereby re integrated into the collective tribe religious community or the natural world itself indeed if we look to recurring themes of UFO encounters we can begin to see not only the occult nature of the phenomenon but also the manner in which this phenomenon has come to reconfigure itself in relation to the uniquely modern form of the human psyche UFO Abduction reports often involve the abductee being placed in a kind of medical operating room or laboratory within which the abductee is anesthetized and subjected to various bizarre medical procedures medicinal practices are in no way specific to the modern scientific and technological World practices of folk medicine and shamanic healing are quite likely just as ancient as Humanity itself and from phenomena such as the so-called placebo effect we can see that the human body and unconscious psyche seem to be highly receptive to any kind of ritualized medical practices technological or otherwise what these abduction cases seem to represent therefore would seem to be an unconscious anxiety and paranoia regarding modern medical practices and there are several reasons why this might be the case throughout the vast majority of human history such medicinal practices were definitively spiritualistic in nature the forms of the medicinal practices were continuous with the mythical and magical cosmologies which were foundational to the human life worlds within which such medicinal practices were carried out moreover healers and shamans were integral members of such premodern communities if you were in need of Medical Aid then the person conducting the medicinal rituals which you were subjected to was almost always a person who you and other members of your community had a very personal relationship with such practices therefore were conditioned by a very intimate and instinctive trust which was cultivated between healer and patient within the modern world conversely technoscientific medicinal practices have become ever more alienated from the patients who are subjected to medical procedures if you are in need of a surgical operation for example it is highly unlikely that you will personally know the surgeons who will be operating upon your body unlike the shamanic and folk medicinal practices of premodern times within which the medicinal practices were directly connected to the overall world viiew shared by the community as a whole technological medicine is shrouded by layers of technical knowledge which are impenetrable to most people in other words you are very unlikely to have any real idea as to what exactly is being done to you within such practices you have very little idea as to how your prescription drugs actually work and what little you think think you know is being accepted by you as an Act of Faith the UFO Abduction phenomenon can be understood therefore as a manifestation of a deeply rooted underlying paranoia which has come to develop due to the increasingly acute alienation of ordinary human beings from the medical practices which they are subjected to trust in modern technoscientific medical practices is an integral aspect ECT of the modernist worldview as a whole and within such UFO Abduction events the trickster archetype appears to be manifesting in such a way that we are forced to confront this ordinarily unquestionable Faith significantly this is a faith which we are placing specifically in the power of modern technoscientific rationality as we look to the overall scope of the UFO phenomenon what we find is that the an xiety towards modern medicine expressed in abduction cases is but a specific instance of the much broader pattern at work here that the UFO phenomenon in general represents a deeply and unconsciously rooted spiritual alienation from Enlightenment rationalism itself when we look to the alleged alien entities themselves a similar Dynamic seems to present itself these alien entities tend to be morphologically dissimilar enough to one another to preclude the possibility of a single extraterrestrial or hyper terrestrial species unless such beings possess far more morphological diversity than any known species of biological organisms here on Earth they are also far too similar to human beings to be likely candidates for a species which is phenetically unrelated to human beings unless anthropic physiology is itself a kind of archetypal attractor which has managed to manifest itself through the evolution of multiple unrelated philogenetic lineages a kind of anthropization akin to the process of carcinization seen in craba likee organisms but seen through a more psychical and archetypal lens we can understand the morphological characteristics of these alleged alien entities as being a manifestation of the exact same unconscious anxieties manifested within the pseudo medal nature of abduction experiences alien entities appear to be almost human but with bulbous heads hairless translucent bodies large eyes and an inability to speak via auditory verbal communication these aliens therefore seem to express numerous features which are associated with infant ille human beings understood within the context of the persistent Association of such beings with Advanced Medical and Military Industrial Technologies we can see that such infantile anthropomorphic features May once again be a manifestation of an unconscious anxiety regarding the nature of science and technology in general Technologies provide us with security and stability qualities which we can see share an archetypal Affinity with the mythical and unconscious imagery of the mother child relationship at an unconscious level therefore we experience ourselves as being increasingly infantilized by technology modernity and scientific rationalism our unconscious need to become independent to face adversity and uncertainty so as to develop a sense of selfefficacy and agency is stifled by the warm comforting Embrace of modern technological civilization while the ego tends to see these Securities and Comforts in a positive light as the ego's primary role is to secure and protect the human organism the unconscious psyche instead tends to develop an intense sense of anxiety due to the manner in which these Comforts hinder the individuation of the human being what the infantile morphological characteristics of these entities seem to represent therefore is an unconscious paranoia regarding what we fear modernity might be transforming us into these aliens are not beings from another planet or from the depths of the Earth's oceans but are rather Phantoms of a perceived future which our Collective unconscious fears it may be blind wandering into in its Quest For Greater stability certainty and Mastery of the natural world broadening our scope we can see that in general the UFO phenomenon tends to shatter the illusion that the makeup of our world is exhausted by that which is commonly understood to be mundane normal and rational the phenomenon insists to us that something lies beyond the bounds of that which is accounted for by modern scientific rationalism though it never gives us a clear picture of what may lie Beyond those bounds the phenomenon always seems to manifest in ways that suggest this incompleteness of scientific rationalism but it rarely manifests in ways that are clear or detailed enough to allow us to make any definitive inferences about what exactly lies beyond that Horizon this persistent ambiguity is not simply due to a lack of adequate theories or evidence on our part but is rather a fundamental feature of the UFO phenomenon the trickster entities are attempting to disrupt destabilize and rupture our rigidified preconceptions and to manifest in such a way that we could easily slot them in as a new addition to our rationalistic worldview would be to defeat the actual purpose of this process in order to perform its psychical function the trickster must reside just upon the outermost edge of that which can be understood and explained if it were much further out from what we can render comprehensible then we would be inclined to dismiss it as a mere hallucination the phenomenon must instead stand right at the precipice between the light cast by modern consciousness and the darkness which envelops it within his psychological research Carl Yung came to see that the trickster archetype played a very similar role within myths dreams and autobiographical narratives the trickster ruptures the solidified patterns within the human psyche and thereby creates a liminality through which the human psyche can reconstitute itself as it continues to pursue the actualization of the ideal archetypal self through the cyclical processes of individuation the trickster archetype therefore like all of the archetypal figures studied by Carl Young ultimately reveals itself to be but one guise or manifestation of the higher self which the individuation process directs itself towards the archetypal trickster much like the senx Ana Shadow great mother and Sky father is in fact but one of the various modalities of the human soul the activity of the trickster therefore is the activity of an ideal potentiality which is attempting to create the conditions needed for its own actualization the modern UFO phenomenon similarly seems to be oriented towards the facilitation of such liminality and Boundary dissolution rather than acting primarily upon the psychical boundaries between self and World however the UFO phenomenon tends to be much more oriented towards destabilizing the boundaries between the rational and the Fantastical moreover the UFO phenomenon does not seem to be oriented exclusively towards the psychical development of individual human beings but is rather a collective Global phenomenon which is acting upon the consciousness of humanity as a whole the UFO phenomenon can thus be understood as the trickster manifestation of the Collective Soul of humanity itself which is calling us forward into whatever lies Beyond the Horizon of technoscientific modernity what we can infer from this is that the collective psyche of humanity is being directed towards a teleological attractor a potentiality which our Collective Consciousness is attemp tempting to actualize in much the same way that the individual human psyche strives towards the actualization of the ideal archetypal self or Soul there is a future state of human Collective Consciousness which is calling us forward as it were and which is necessitating that the rigid boundaries of modern scientific rationalism be destabilized and subsequently reconstituted in accordance with the ideal or potentiality which we are approaching the UFO is therefore a distinctly modernist iteration of the exact same process which we see in the transition from saturnian to Jovian culture forms over the course of the axial age so does this analysis then imply that there are in fact no black technology projects Oceanic hyper terrestrials or archaeological discoveries of anti deluvian anti-gravity engines are we to infer that the alleged Aerospace Vehicles encountered by military personnel are in fact merely apparitions my suspicion is that this may in fact be the case but I also do not believe that it is necessarily the case and there are some reasons to believe that the qualities of these occurrences might actually point to physically actual phenomena within the natural world which are not accounted for by mainstream science during the 18th and 19th centuries these eidolons appeared within hot air balloons in the early 20th century they appeared in Zeppelins both of these were very real Technologies which were at The Cutting Edge of technological development during those time periods it is only after World War II that these entities began appearing as Aerospace craft which seemed to be far beyond the bounds of what known Technologies are capable of so what are we to make of this why didn't these entities begin appearing within jet fighters Saturn 5 Rockets or space shuttles rather than bizarre ooid or triangular objects which bear very little resemblance to human Aerospace Technologies one possibility could simply be that during this time period these trickster entities came to be fueled by kind of urgency which has compelled them to begin stepping ever further outside of our boundaries of perceived normaly perhaps this amplification of the phenomenon both in terms of apparent technological advancement as well as sheer quantity of occurrences could have been fueled by the effects brought about within our Collective unconscious through the development of nuclear weapons but another possibility is that these entities have actually not changed their qualitative features of their manifestations at all these eidolons have in fact continued to manifest in the guise of the most Advanced Technologies which have been developed by human beings only now the Technologies which are truly at The Cutting Edge are those which are kept secret from mainstream science and mainstream culture in general the question as to whether or not such secretive post einsteinian Technologies do in fact exist is which extends far beyond the scope of this video and so I won't be weighing in on that debate here though I will say that given what I know about the topic it seems quite clear that one of two possibilities must be the case if not both on the one hand is the possibility that secretive governmental organizations have in fact developed Aerospace Technologies which extend far beyond the bounds of what is considered possible by mainstream physics on the other hand is the possibility that such governmental organizations have made a highly concerted and well- financed effort towards cultivating and fueling speculations that they are in possession of such Technologies it seems to me that the latter possibility is almost certainly the case which unfortunately though perhaps purposefully makes evaluation of the first possibility almost futile likewise I am not willing to fully discount the possibility that some sort of hyper terrestrial nonhuman or quasi humans might in fact be residing beneath the earth's oceans or elsewhere this possibility does seem immensely Fantastical when seen through the lens of the modern worldview of scientific rationalism but of course the limitations of this worldview are the primary target of the UFO phenomenon itself and therefore we would expect the phenomenon to incorporate into itself anything which resides on the outermost borders of what we are willing to believe is possible whether those features of the UFO phenomenon actually correspond to features of the natural world is in my opinion a question which must remain open to evaluation on a caseby casee basis so now let us return to the issue of blurred boundaries between the psychological and the physical my analysis thus far would imply that the entities encountered within UFO experiences are in fact primarily psychical in nature these are beings which reside within our Collective Consciousness rather than extrasolar planets or secretive Oceanic habitats yet as we have already examined there is a decidedly dual nature to these occurrences they seem to be as much physical as psychical must we then infer that the psychical realm is able to actually alter the Physical Realm in objectively observable ways it's it seems to me that despite how much this conclusion might stand at odds with our preconceived ontological categories it is one which is ultimately inescapable if one attempts to actually Accord with the evidence at hand these psychical entities seem to be quite capable of physically affecting human bodies manifesting in ways that can be detected by radar systems and multiple eyewitness observers and leaving physical traces behind in the wake of such manifestations the implications of this are immense and far-reaching but it also seems highly appropriate that the UFO phenomenon would bring us into confrontation with such a possibility perhaps the reconceptualization of the categorical boundaries between the world of physicality and the world of Consciousness is itself a crucial development which the modern UFO phenomenon is functioning to move us towards modern science tends to orient itself as much as it possibly can at least towards the physical the world of definite particular and quantifiable determinations in which possibilities must be evaluated in terms of non-contradiction in terms of either or relationships in which only one possibility among various Alternatives can actually be the case in forcing us into confrontation with the world of Consciousness however the UFO phenomen on also brings us into confrontation with a world of potentialities a world in which seemingly contradictory qualities are harmoniously integrated into composite images of distributed possibilities the collective unconscious is not limited to the actuality of what Humanity currently is but rather contains within itself the realities of everything that Humanity has ever been ever could have been and could ever possibly come to be we can see within the subatomic realm that Quantum entities are superpositional existing within a diffuse cloud of possible States and physical locations until interactions occur which collapse this cloud of possibility into a discrete event while the rational mind attempts to see the world in terms of non-contradiction thus insisting that the entity must be either here or there this or that the world of Consciousness is one in which rationalistic thought reaches its outermost limits as such Mutual exclusivity is a feature of the physical world but not of nature in general rationalistic thinking is oriented precisely towards the World of Concrete determinations whereas the world of Consciousness is one of indeterminacy as it is a world which precedes and conditions the possibility of such corporeal determination as we have already seen the UFO phenomenon seems to manifest in ways which are relative to The Observers who undergo such experiences the entities experienced tend to appear in ways which are specific to the historical periods in which they are observed similarly the manifestations of the phenomenon seem to be conditioned by the particular circumstances within which they are experienced many such encounters occur within the context of military operations and within such context the phenomenon tends to manifest in a specifically militaristic manner seen through the lens of military operations Technologies and relevance Frameworks the phenomenon tends to appear as though it were itself a kind of military Aerospace technology when context ized by different kinds of contexts and observers the phenomenon comes to manifest in drastically different ways what this might then imply is that the underlying phenomenon itself is characterized by a kind of indeterminacy much like the indeterminacy of a Quantum entity which then collapses into a discrete form depending upon the context within which it comes to be a participant within a particular event of conscious experience as I have suggested in previous videos human integral or imaginal awareness can be understood as being this very capacity to perceive the indeterminate structures of possibility which underly what our sensory organs encounter as the physical corporeal World our very inability to grasp the UFO phenomenon that is our inability to force it into a predetermined rationalistic grid is indicative of the fundamental nature of the phenomenon as a process by which our Collective awareness is being drawn towards novel developments of human consciousness itself overall it would thus seem that the UFO phenomenon functions not only as a disruptive Force intent upon destabilizing the architecture of modern technoscientific rationalism but also as a kind of lure one which is through its own nature guiding us unto the Developmental Pathways of thought which our Collective psyche must undertake in order to move beyond the constricting saturnian boundaries which we have come to construct around ourselves thanks for watching

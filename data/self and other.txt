the issue is not the existence of distinction but how one orients their self wrt the other, how one relates to the boundary of their own identity

one either accepts or rejects the other.

purest love is an unconditional acceptance of the other as distinct from the self. whereas fear is a hostile stance towards the other that attempts to either conquer or ignore it

rejection of the Other thus becomes either ‘i want you to become like me so that my Self identity territorializes the land of the Other’ or it can be denial of the other’s existence: ‘i’m going to ignore the other and pretend only self exists’

the first case manifests as a totalitarian will to control and twists the other from the end into the means

in the second case, ai allows the self to live in a larger self identity bubble than ever before and so many people don’t live authentic social lives anymore

both require embracing the will of the other to resist

the Resistor has taken a hostile stance toward the other and is attempting to reunify all others into himself, back into the primordial oneness of lifeless we all emerged from. otoh the Redeemer enables acceptance of the Other, despite our imperfections

now can we formalize this and make machines love the other?

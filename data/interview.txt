[Music] cut those people [Music] out welcome to the Apex energy podcast I'm your host Sam alatan uh today my guest is forms Scapes how are you doing today um you also go by Keen right yeah yeah kin's my name forms Scapes is my YouTube channel and my general internet moniker uh but yeah so glad to be here glad to be here awesome yeah do you mind just giving like a brief introduction about yourself like what what do you do what kind of subjects you talk about on YouTube ah man it's it's a little bit difficult to encapsulate but um generally speaking uh I'm a philosopher I I deal with a number of different topics within that realm um process philosophy is is one uh the German idealist German phenomenology movement is another I also delve into a lot of peripheral topics that can link in with that ideas in uh the philosophy of biology for example um ideas about morphogenetics um Divergent ideas Within science broadly speaking and so it's a pretty broad territory I also kind of dip into uh more esoteric or even theological topics sometimes as they fit into the pictures that I try to sketch out so yeah that's that's the general gist at least okay yeah awesome uh and we are going to be diving into many of the subjects that you um just mentioned but before we do I just kind of want to give a preface to the viewer that um we you know in in contemporary uh science there seems to exist this so-called scientific uh world view and it seems that so many people within this 21st century are Charmed by the scientific method because of you know the the development of Technologies and the development of modern medicine so the scientific method had holds a high place within Western cultures especially but just in the 21st century normally I would say just people people hold it up to a very high standard however there seems to be this belief that is sandwiched in with with this scientific method uh and let's call this belief the the philosophy of materialism right and materialism is basically this idea that that matter is unconscious that the universe is purposeless that animals and biological organisms are mechanical in nature Richard Dawkins called uh uh living beings as lumbering robots with central nervous systems right so it's basically this this stereotypical you know atheist materialist belief that has had has has kind of merged itself with the scientific worldview so in the spirit of uh uh science let's use skepticism let's kind of analyze some of these beliefs if you don't mind and we'll go through and I'll ask you some questions just to get uh some of your input so let's start with the question first of all what what is this philosophy of materialism to you and what do those beliefs uh entail well as with any belief system materialism uh is a story it's it's got its own history of how and why it came about and that story is very much interlined with Transformations that were happening in philosophy really over the C course of the past 400 years or so you could trace back much further than that if you wanted to you could you could take this all the way back to uh the medieval Scholastics in the 13th century actually that's not a bad starting point actually but a lot of people will kind of set the the initial goal post at Renee decart who much like Richard Dawkins uh suggested that most uh or really all plants and animals other than human beings were automata they were machines essentially and it was humans uh who were unique in in actually having Consciousness and being truly animate in other words and so it's it's really with deart that you get the beginnings first of all with the the the initial break of Western Philosophy from the Western tradition itself and the birth of a truly modern philosophy um but second of all it's also the beginnings of of what we could call dualism the idea that subjectivity subjective interiority is somehow of a completely different ontological or metaphysical register than materiality materiality um becomes conceptualized as that which is purely objective it lacks interiority it's characterized fundamentally by um what later philosophers would go on to call primary qualities but not secondary quality so you get this idea uh developed later on in the British empiricist tradition that objects in the world uh have these qualities that are relative to Observer so for example the way that uh a an item of food tastes is relational with regards to the subjectivity of the person eating the food so that's not a that's a secondary quality as they said and then a primary quality um that would be objective things such as the the actual chemical composition of the uh the food the the carbohydrates and sugars glucose things like that and so then uh this division gets further elaborated in K uh you get the phenomenal realm as divided from the ninal realm and then that becomes its whole thing because that spins off into the German idealism movement and essentially what happens gradually over time is you have this tendency developing whereby scientists and some philosophers really not that many but at least a good handful began really during the 19th Cent Cy this tendency of taking that mind matter bifurcation and then just sawing off the Mind part of it so that somehow you could you could explain everything including mind including subjectivity in terms of the purely objective and uh this of course created a a very difficult conceptual tight rope to try to walk and I I think we're at a place right now at least within academic philosophy and many scientists as well are beginning to come around to this too that there just is no way to square that Circle you're never going to get Consciousness out of just dead inert lifeless bbes bouncing around in the void and and that's kind of where we're at right now and that's kind of what I what I've waited into because even though there is I think a growing acknowledgment within within Academia that um ideas like panchis and idealism or or just theism more generally um have to be taken seriously and they they have to uh be regarded as as legitimate ways of of dealing with these problems that were generated by materialism nevertheless there's there's still this kind of hanging on to the idea that we can just kind of Recon iiz things and then somehow all of the established academic mainstream science will remain intact after that and that's just not going to happen there's so many things Downstream of this that are that follow from reconceptualizing how we think about Consciousness and how we think about matter and this is a big problem for a lot of people because for a lot of people that materialism isn't just uh little metaphysical presupposition that's you know performing this purely analytic function the very idea of scientific Prestige and materialism the idea of really just knowledge in general and the way that we've come to conceptualize it especially after World War II uh and and caring over into the 21st century has developed this form where it really has come to serve as a kind of pseudo religion for people in a lot of ways um and when that happens people get really defensive about it once once you've got something that's not just a belief once it starts to become a grounding for your sense of security and orientation towards the world then it gets personal and uh that's that's the kind of thing that you see once you start bumping into these issues yeah okay great answer and I really just want to flesh out um your answer pretty much because there's there's so much packed in there so so much I want to uh know and understand I'll start with this question basically I want to get your your just straightup opinion about um is the question is is matter conscious or sorry is matter unconscious um I'm not sure if the IDE well okay I should start with this we of course I have to do the pedantic philosopher thing and say it depends on how you define consciousness but if we're meaning that very broadly in the sense of subjectivity of some kind of primordial feeling or experience or awareness I'm not convinced that there's any coherent way to conceptualize anything as being purely objective without any relationship to subjectivity whatsoever um because once you do that things just they get weird and and you can dance around it but um so for example the world that we inhabit obviously has Consciousness in it because we're here to observe it but then start thinking about possible universes right could we imagine a universe in which there was no consciousness in which you really just had BB's bouncing around in the void but then you have to ask this question in what sense would a hypothetical Universe like that actually be real as opposed to merely possible as opposed to merely a potentiality for this universe we have a very ready answer to that which is well we're we're here for it right if there's nobody who's there for it in what sense is there anything that distinguishes it from being merely a potentiality merely something Fantastical as opposed to really real um and so I think there's a very deep connection here and it's very this would get us into some very metaphysical territory if we start to try to really pry into this but just to summarize very quickly I think there is a very deep connection between the very idea of Consciousness and the Very idea of existence itself yeah you can't really separate those two things I don't think okay interesting so I think I think it might be helpful um to just hold on to this uh uh this mind and matter split this materialist split and operate from that perspective and just just to see how things line up so let's kind of stay within it and compare it maybe to other uh different models that philosophers and scientists have have presented so let's start from the point of uh what is the bifurcation of of nature you've talked about it in some of your your videos what is it uh how did it come about and how does it um affect affect the thought and the metaphysics of of the masses yeah so that that phrase bifurcation of nature is something that I'm borrowing from uh the metaphysician and mathematician Alfred North Whitehead who has been a huge influence on on my work and um as whad sees it uh it's essentially what I just said about decart it's the idea that there can be this prying apart of Consciousness from purely objective materiality and uh in doing so you you you generate a a very large number of conceptual problems that that um I would argue aren't really solvable um but this goes a bit deeper than that and well I if I should stay deeper than that that's that's really the Bedrock of it I should say that it it fans out into other areas let's put it that way in the sense that it kind of goes hand inand with an idea which is actually maybe a bit more ancient now that I'm thinking about it that the human world that that that Humanity itself is something separate from nature um and especially in the modern world in which we're just completely undated with Technologies um it's really easy to kind of buy into that idea without even even noticing that it's there because it's it's really gotten to the point where all of our um relationships with reality in general are mediated in some way or another by technology I mean you really have to go out of your way to put that all aside and to just be in the world and so it reinforces this idea which is implicit within this bifurcation of nature that reality itself is fundamentally mechanical when you're surrounded by machines then it it feels like much less of a stretch to think that the whole world is consists entirely of mechanical processes that that living organisms are somehow just squishy machines and that there's all there is to it and if we just you know continued along doing uh science for long enough eventually we would figure out how everything can be just reduced down to particles and motion and we'll get there eventually we promise you know um and again any thread you pull on here you're going to you're going to reveal cracks within it right within living systems in particular um that way of looking at it doesn't work and when you actually you know if you look past you know some biologists Like Richard Dawkins for example has this very mechanistic rhetoric about life you know he calls it the blind watch maker right implying that nature is blind and that organisms are like watches they're machines somehow um if you look past that though and you look at what biologists are actually doing um often times the way they think about things doesn't actually Accord with that at all they and when it comes to where the rubber actually meets the road they don't think of organisms as machines because dealing with that is just an extremely sloppy way of of addressing how biological processes actually operate in the real world and so you have to have this kind of you know elaborate apologetics in which you have to somehow suggest that all of these different terms used by biologists can somehow at the end of the day be broken down into mere matter and again it's it's just one of those things where it's an uncashed check it you'll never actually be able to to to accomplish that I don't think it certainly isn't going to be accomplished anytime soon and so it's just kind of this promise that eventually we'll get there right okay and uh I know that the traditional uh view of of mind and matter is that the mind is inside of you know a central nervous system or within a brain let's say encapsulated and that matter is out there so the difference is uh a difference of location a difference in space I know I'm not very well versed into Whitehead I'm I'm so curious about him and this is partly the reason why I really wanted to get you on but Whitehead I read that he he differentiates mind and matter as a difference within time as opposed to it being spatial are you familiar with that concept and and um maybe if you do if you are could you explain it further uh no I he doesn't really distinguish mind and matter at all um okay so whad um so he develops this fundamental metaphysics within his Harvard gford lectures which then became the book process and reality and in that he conceptualize the the world in such a way that the ontological fundamental so the most basic building blocks of nature are what he calls occasions of experience sometimes he'll call them actual entities to suggest that all actual entity entities all actualities have these properties he's describing um at one point he describes them as um electromagnetic droplets of experience which I think is just a a wonderfully poetic way of putting it uh which is also suggestive about all kinds of ways in which this might link up with uh physics but in any case um the way that he kind of um elaborates what he sees as the anatomy of these droplets um is is a you could call it a a polarity right so you have a mental pole and a physical pole um but and and I think this is probably what you stumbled across because because the way he uses those terms doesn't quite Accord with the way we typically use them Cally we think of mental as the realm of the subjective whereas physical is just like merely physical but for Whitehead these are two different kinds of basic experiences so there's physical experiences you can call that sensation for example that your contact with the world and then uh the what he's calling the mental Pole those are what he calls calls them conceptual prehensions and so those are basically feelings of possibilities and so you can think of that those mental poles those conceptual prehensions as being kind of like a a the you can think of it as being the mode of our awareness which is concerned with possibility you can think of it as kind of a field of possibilities that we think kind of collapse down into actualities actual events and then once those events have occurred then they be they become available to uh be inherited into subsequent moments which is the the the realm of sensation so for example like whenever you're looking just at the world around you um in a sense all of your sensory impressions are of the past they are of events that have already happened right so no matter how close something is to your face the light takes some concrete amount of time to travel and therefore you're seeing the the events in question as they were one you know light meter ago or whatever the case may be right and the same thing goes uh for our our bodies right our physical sensation of our bodies is uh the state our bodies were in a moment ago and that that is then kind of Amalgamated with all these different all these other aspects of our experience um and so uh not to get super technical with it just to summarize a bit here the overall gist of whitee head's philosophy is that he sees these actual entities these moments of experience as being the basic building blocks of organisms and so for whad the basic procy which um constitute the world are organic processes which are fundamentally animate fundamentally experiential they're fundamentally self-generative in many ways so there's there's a kind of indeterminacy there but it's it's not a probabilistic indeterminacy it's a self-determination and so yeah what he's doing is it you can really think of it as um the British empiricist tradition taken to its logical extreme just becomes a new fangled form of shamanic animism because that's that's kind of what it is in certain ways so interesting yeah that's I know that's that's really the fascinating part with me because I'm familiar with the shamanic animism and and hearing this process philosophy just sounds so much like it um let's stay on the topic of of Alfred North Whitehead do you mind just giving a little bit of backstory behind who this guy is and why is he so important yeah so Whitehead was um one of the biggest names in mathematical logic during the late 19th and early 20th centuries um he worked very closely with bertran Russell who is another big name within U the the realm of of Western analytic philosophy in general but also mathematical logic uh they wrote a book called The prinkipia Mathematica which know one ever reads because it looks like hieroglyphics but it exists and supposedly it's important so anyway um uh and so uh in World War I Whitehead's son died uh in in in comat and this was a very devastating life event for him and ultimately he ended up selling most of his possessions and leaving Britain for the United States where he ended up uh teaching philosophy at Harvard and that's where he began to take in a lot of inspiration from the American pragmatist tradition particularly The Works of William James and John Dewey and um while there he begins to uh develop these um broader ideas about really the the very nature of science and and where science is at and how that relates to philosophical tradition and eventually by 1927 this is going to become his process philosophy his big picture metaphysical scheme of things um and it's also worth keeping in mind here that Whitehead um you know being a a mathematician and a logician is also very much shoulder and shoulder with what's happening in the world of physics around the time um he was in communication with Einstein he was actually very critical in many ways of Einstein's general relativity um according to Einstein whenever they talked Einstein couldn't understand a word that Whitehead was trying to say to him which is kind of funny though I do wonder what those conversations were like but in any case um this was also around the exact same time that the the origins of what will eventually become U Quantum field Theory and particle physics a standard model all that was kind of cooking at the time right and so 1914 that's where you had uh Mox plank um quantized electromagnetism he brings in this idea that you can divide up um any kind of photonic or electromagnetic events into these discret quanta they're not perfectly continuous and infinitely divisible there are packets involved somehow now in 1927 the exact same time that white has given the gford lectures that will become process in reality uh that's the same year um oh I always forg get the name of it there was this this conference at the time everybody's seen the pictures it's like that that photo and it's like all the physicists and Einstein and Neil's boore they're all there together that was that event and so that's where all of the major ideas that we typically associate with quantum mechanics uh came into play because they were all just kind of derived from that quantization of electromagnetism which had been put on the table 14 years prior and so at at in that year that's where you get the uncertainty principle the complimentarity principle non-locality blah blah blah blah blah all of it kind of comes in at that point and so Whitehead he's definitely got his uh fingers on the puls of that as it were and you can see it in many ways throughout uh process in reality the way that he conceptualizes these moments of experience as being Atomic not in the sense of like little BBS but Atomic in the sense of being these kind of discreet indivisible units it's pretty clear that he's drawing from Plank's quantization of electromagnetism in um framing things that way and a number of other things but anyway that's that's the general idea and um this is really important I think because in a lot of ways Whitehead is kind of revivifying the platonic tradition there's a lot of ways in which his philosophy is just kind of platonism but there's also a lot of ways in which it's not because he's also incorporating all these ideas that have been developed over the subsequent 2,500 years he's trying to really be true to the tradition of British empiricism and the scientific tradition and kind of incorporate those things into what he's doing and so it's really important I think because it gives us a way to kind of take all of these more modern ideas and concepts of things that we've learned about the world um over the course of of modernity and weave those together with these these you know mystical philosophical metaphysical Traditions that take us way back into uh the origins of uh certainly helenic civilization probably much much further than that but at the very least that far so yeah okay awesome I want to understand process philosophy a little bit more uh it does sound like to quote you gobby g when I watch some some of the videos it gets it gets really deep really fast and Rupert sheldrick himself notoriously said that it was difficult for him to follow at first as well so if you don't mind let's go ahead and just kind of break down some Concepts and and Define them and explain how the mechanisms might work um concrescence from what I understand is the the coming together of this physical pole and the mental pole and that's what um this actuality is right or something being created I guess or something existing is that the right way maybe to frame it yeah so the word concrescence there's there's kind of an intimation there of uh convalescence coalesence things coming together to form holes and that's really important here uh Whitehead says concrescence is the process by which the many become one and are increased by one so what he means by that then is that you're taking a multiplicity of different little kind of atomic experience Atomic relations and you're weaving them together into a totality that is more than the sum of its parts right you know they become one and are increased by one as in as in the wholeness that is achieved is something really ontologically separate than the parts it's not a mere aggregation so guring towards a veryan idea very organismic idea of ontological holism here um so if you you may have run across the term holon at some point very similar to that um and uh yeah so the concrescent really is just Whitehead's term for any organic process and and really even mechanistic processes are just kind of aggregations of organic processes right so if you think about something like your phone for example is not itself an organic hole per se its structure is imposed upon it by human beings but if you zoom in the level of the silicate molecules and polymers and whatnot what you find are these self-perpetuating self-generating systems that are um just because of their the the form that we have imposed upon them they're just kind of sitting there inert just kind of repeating themselves because that's how we like it we like things to be very predictable when we make machines and and computer systems and things like that because if a machine has a mind of its own that's usually not a compliment you want things to behave in very predictable ways in so far as you're thinking technologically but organisms are not like that organisms uh are always navigating distributions of possibility and for Whitehead that's what he's referring to by the mental pull the conceptual prehensions the feelings of possibilities that the organism is then kind of selecting from or drawing into itself in a selective way so as to kind of reshape itself as it as it navigates the world okay and mechanizing and and creating a linear system out of organisms is not really an alien idea to us I mean we do it to animals and plants so doing that extrapolating that further into um you know like particles within physics would actually kind of make sense we we kind of just do that with with everything around us um okay so he also has this term prehension that you mentioned as well prehension from what I understand is seizing or grasping and it can occur in in in in different ways so there's three types of uh prehension from what I understand there's a conceptual prehension um and then there's a physical prehension and a hybrid prehension and I'll just and just let me know if any of this is uh wrong but physical prehension from what I know is going from past to present uh which which is essentially ordinary U physics right the stuff that we study um in schools and then we have this conceptual prehension which is uh grasping on or seizing the past which is from present to past right it's the other way around is that is that correct it it's it's more like present to future for concepion because you're you're looking at possibilities that have not been actualized yet in order to kind of determine how things come to actualize essentially that's so they're potentialities yes that EXA could exist within the future okay and what about hybrid for ion what is that so that's where things get a little bit more complicated but it's also where things get really interesting before I I talk about that though uh one quick thing is I I think it's actually better to say that there are four types of prehensions and the reason why is simply because of that kind of holism I was talking about before so um so a prehension again it's a grasping is and the reason he's using a term like that is because he's trying to emphasize this idea that within our experience it's our experience is not just a kind of mirroring of the world it's not just like we've got this heads up display screen that is our Consciousness that's just depicting the world to us our Consciousness is an incorporation of the world into us right and uh all experience operates that way now um with regards to oh yeah that fourth thing so uh yeah you got physical prehensions comp or excuse me conceptual prehensions hybrid prehensions and then the whole that is generated from that synthesis is itself a prehension it is a complex feeling and so he calls that a complex prehension and so that's like the fourth type is like the the synthesis of the the former three yeah interesting and that creates a hole and and that those holes themselves right is that correct interact with other holes and that creates another or a hoon is it is it is the correct term a holon or a hole when it creates a new kind of yeah you could call it a ho on so so you he uses this term Society a lot which seems like he's he's basically using that term as synonymous with organism which is to say that you if you think of your um your um composition you can think of it as this really complex web of um smaller actual entities smaller uh moments of becoming that are all just kind of woven together into this um social hole um and yeah you could you could think of that as a a hole on I think as a good term to use here um and yeah I mean this is something that you can you can scale up or down pretty much indefinitely you could you could look at a tribe A Town a village as um really being its own kind of Nexus of experience um you could look at like an ant colony or a beehive for example in the same way it's kind of just a matter of how interwoven things are because that's then going to determine the degree to which the individual constituents are able to kind of operate on their own and kind of just carry out their own um desire for um uh uh self-generation and whatnot with something like a beehive or an ant colony or whatnot you don't have very much Agency for the individual Parts um and therefore I I think we could say that the Consciousness which we see there as at is it's more at the colonial level whereas for us human beings it seems like our Consciousness is much more localized within individual so if there's a a kind of social Consciousness for like a a tribe or a town or a city or a nation or what have you that's a bit dimmer you could say um than individual human consciousness so yeah okay awesome and what about the term he uses the term Eternal objects what does he mean when he refers to that so those those are your potentialities they the term Eternal object is kind of like wh head's term for platonic forms and he he intentionally Dodges the word form for certain technical reasons we don't really need to get into but yeah that's essentially what he's talking about he's talking about possibilities in themselves um which then organisms uh kind of latch onto prehend as it were and then they kind of come together into these uh comp Le Lex Eternal objects complex forms like what you see in living bodies for example and uh that's that's just how that navigation of possibility space Works essentially okay awesome and U I want to ask now about another process philosopher hre bergon um who who is he and how does he play into this whole process philosophy uh so bergsen uh interestingly was another mathematician he was a a French mathematician initially who became a philosopher um over the course of his career and in many ways his philosophy is a lot like whiteheads um it's his philosophy is very um evolutionary in character he he thinks of time as being an expression of creativity very similar to what Whitehead's doing um and um a lot of bergson's philosophy was focused on time in particular and um the and and and really the ways in which our modern scientific ways of thinking about time just don't really Accord with what time has to be if we actually look at it through the lens of of our experience when we actually look at the phenomenon of time as it is actually presented to us in the real world as opposed to filtered through a you know very complex web of mathematical equations and abstract ideas and whatnot bergson uh much like Whitehead is very uh interested in remaining true to the reality of our experience because according to both of them um once you once you detach yourself from experience you're not doing science anymore let alone well you're not doing philosophy anymore more let alone science because the whole idea of science the whole idea of natural philosophy is empiricism to begin with the world we actually encounter and to go from there so if at some point you're kind of kicking out the ladder underneath you and saying that our experience is just some kind of Illusion or simulation or you know whatever the the the hot word is this week you're really sing off the branch you're sitting on because then you don't have a way to refer back to the ground that you're supposedly starting from and then you're just kind of you've just kind of bootstrapped yourself into this world of of Fantastical abstraction at that point so bergson and Whitehead are both trying to avoid that um Whitehead is a very nice term that he uses for this he says um he uses the term misplaced concreteness to refer to what he sees as this tendency whereby we take our abstractions our models and whatnot and then kind of mistake the map for the territory um and again B bergon is also very uh keenly aware of this problem and so uh bergson in in pursuing these questions he arrives at some very interesting conclusions many of which do Jive pretty well with Whitehead's ideas and sheldrick's ideas sheldrick was very much influenced by Burg's own even more so than Whitehead um bergson concludes that memories cannot just be stored in the brain somehow they have to be regenerations of what has actually occurred in the past um he also says that time must be understood as a kind of uh excuse me a kind of withholding or Force stalling of decisions um he he thinks about the way we experience um objects in the world in terms of potentiality so Whitehead's talking about you know us feeling these uh um fields of possibility and then we have kind of our sensory experience and and we would associate that with our um encounters with physical objects in the world around us burkson uh kind of takes that a step further in a way and he says that even our experiences of objects in the world are really experiences of possible actions in a way and so we we could go on and on about this bergson is actually a someone who I've I've been trying to delve into more so lately I'm much more familiar with Whitehead really um but yeah burkson uh again he was also very critical of Einstein's uh special relativity in particular and so uh yeah again you have this kind of connection to uh the Transformations happening in physics around that time period in the early 20th century okay so yeah were they influenced by each other did or did those ideas emerge independently uh I think it was mostly independent I know whad was at least familiar with bergson because he references him a couple of times I'm not entirely sure if bergson was familiar with Whitehead but again I'm less familiar with bergson's body of work so it just might be that I haven't he talks about Whitehead yet so essentially uh subjectivity then is a fundamental aspect of reality it cannot just be written out way the way the materialists try to write it out within this modern scientific worldview um just in in so many aspects we're trying to always get quote unquote objective results and remove the so suck the subjectivity out but that's it's it's impossible um it's just not possible it's it's a dead end won't lead anywhere essentially right right and uh really what we're trying to achieve here is we're trying to achieve inter subjectivity because we're trying to achieve we're trying to reveal the compositional features of nature um which transcend particular events particular relationships we're trying to look at that which we can generalize because then once we can generalize then we can do something with that we can build spaceships and whatnot once we're able to figure out how these different things interact and so that that kind of um drive towards understanding nature um it it has been kind of uh mutated in some ways over time so um if you look at figures like Isaac Newton or Yan Von Gerta for example or even the medieval Alchemist for that matter um all of these guys were Mystics I mean they really saw what they were doing not as trying to understand a world of dead inert BB's M bouncing around they were trying to understand the mind of God um and they were quite literal about that you know and so there there was not yet this uh pretention of just transcending subjectivity entirely that wasn't there and in fact Gerta in particular is very adamant about this in a way that's um very reminiscent of the way Whitehead and bergson are going to be about it later on this insistence that we don't get lost in our abstractions um in his critique of Newton for example and although Newton was definitely a Mystic in his own right as well gerd is very um critical of Newton in that he thinks that Newton in trying to understand the nature of light he's employing these ideas of waves and frequencies and things like that and and so um Newton is trying to kind of reduce down the experience of color down to these alleged um physical properties such as the wavelengths of light and uh ger is like this this can never work and he points to the fact that um our color is necessarily a relational phenomenon something that looks blue within one context can look gray in another and you don't have to do anything to the wavelengths of light they needn't change at all and so what Gerta is drawing from this he's like it's it you know there's a relationship to to what the light's doing sure but light itself or excuse me color itself is a relational phenomenon it is something that happens between Observer and World um and so you you can't just divide this up into primary and secondary qualities um so so gerch is like look if we're going to really understand color we need to actually understand the rainbow and stop pretending that we're trying to understand something kind of pre subjective underlying that look at the actual structure of the color wheel itself and how that actually operates and so he develops this this theory of Optics which is actually very elaborate but his starting Place very different than Newton's Newton's trying to start with something that's purely physical at least as much as he possibly can um Gerta understands it in this much more kind of esoteric way he tries to understand color in terms of this Dynamic interplay between light and darkness um and is super fascinating it's it's a really cool theory that he developed and it seems to aord um uh very well with with our modern understanding of how color perception actually works so that's I yeah I have to check that out that's sounds awesome I didn't even know G yeah Gerta just sound like that guy was different man I mean he was doing it all the literature the science the just the philosophy I mean yeah just theology I mean he he really he was a yeah definitely he was he was the uh the renaissance man so to speak yeah um okay so um I want to ask about go back to re burkson um from what I know he kind of counteracted this cartisian split by presenting something called mechanical and an organic causation did you is that the similar to um Whitehead's ideas yeah it's essentially the same thing we've got going on with Whitehead though bergson conceptualizes it a bit differently the way that burgon thinks of it um you kind of think of it like this like Whitehead is kind of oriented more towards the future in a way like he's thinking of like conceptual prehension as this kind of possibility space um and there's there's definitely room for that in bergson's philosophy I think they complement each other very well but the way bergson looks at it is um the way that these processes relate to the past so bergson says that within a mechanical process You' really just got something where the like immediately prior event just kind of necessitates what happens in the subsequent event so just like dominoes knocking each other over right whereas within organic processes organic causation um there's this incorporation of a a kind of broader scope of the past and this is where um bergson's ideas start to really incorporate um ideas about memory and learning into his his fun the fundamentals of his understanding of Consciousness so you know typically within the the modern kind of neuros psychological way we think about these things we tend to think of learning and memory as things that are like specialized functions that our nervous systems perform for us bergson says no these are actually fundamental to the nature of animacy itself and what we see in the human being is are just very elaborated forms of these fundamental archetypes but the these fundamental archetypes of memory and learning um are there at the Bedrock um and so um if you think about it in a way this makes sense whenever you make a kind of Split Second decision where you're just kind of um not really thinking about it you know it is more mechanical in a sense um but then there's this kind of withholding when you're really thinking when you're really present for what you're doing where you are in thinking about the decision that you're making you're kind of incorporating you're reining the past the things that you've done before that may relate to what you're doing now in some way or another so as to inform the way that you're doing what you're doing now so there's this kind of uh rebirth as it were of the past into the present and the way that bergon thinks about it is the more we're doing that the more of the past we're bringing into the present the more um the more um Consciousness is there in a word the more the more um intensity there is within that moment of experience we could say okay and um so how do these ideas relate or overlap with German idealism specifically with k um kant's ideas um and with phenomena and Numa how how does this does it overlap or is it kind of a little bit different so this is a long story so um okay yeah but but let's let's do it all right so um so let's start with um bergson so so with within k um you've got this phenomena Numa distinction where there's the phenomenal realm which is the world of basically what you call secondary quality ities that which is structured by the organizational principles of our Consciousness so as to kind of render the world to us and then you have the ninal reality which is the world in itself now the way that Kant conceptualizes this there's not really a way to actually contact the world itself all we ever actually contact our phenomena and so we can't really say anything about what the world actually is there's uh presumably got to be something behind our experiences but what is that we can't know and within K's philosophy this is really a line that he's drawing in a very purposeful way because this is the critique of pure reason which is to say delineating the bounds of what pure reason can actually do and outside of those bounds that's where K's going to place his belief in God and Free Will and these other things that he feels like have been endangered by the advance of modern philosophy since cart uh bergson and Whitehead are not going to be cool with that way of doing things so so bergson the way he handles this is very interesting um and actually I should back up a little bit before before uh going on to burdson we should look at how that kind of Conan conception plays into modern materialism there's this idea that there's the world that we experience it and there's this presumption that whatever is behind those experiences is matter matter in itself which has these these purely objective uh qualities and that's just all there is to it it's just mere matter and so what buron does is very clever he's like okay sure let's let's let's buy that so the world in itself independently of us is made of mere matter Okay cool so uh but we're going to be good empiricists about this we're gonna we're not g to overstretch into any weird metaphysical abstractions so all we've got is what we experience and then that which is still there when we look away because that that's how it works you you look away from the thing and you look back the thing is still still there so what's there uh when you're not looking bergson says well there's only one thing it could possibly be potential experiences or he says virtual experiences so there's this idea um that Buren's getting at which again Jes very well with Whitehead that matter itself consists uh you could say of possible relationships and those possible relationships once they are actualized are the contents of experience uh and you see something very similar in Whitehead Whitehead's very adamant that he's wanting to break down this barrier that he feels like Kant has erected between us and the world and this this is part of the reason like I mentioned before why he's uh using this term prehension this idea of grasping and this idea experiences are not just a screen that the world is projected on there's actually a direct kind of symbiosis with the world that occurs in our experience and it is that symbiosis um that that shapes what our experience actually is so there's still room for um perspectivity here in the sense that the way that the thing is revealed within my Consciousness might be different than the way that is revealed within your Consciousness because we might looking at it from different angles or thinking with different ideas or whatever the case may be but ultimately we are disclosing this kind of complex um lattice of of possible experiences there and what we are revealing what we're encountering is the thing itself because the thing itself is composed of those possible relationships and so we're just actualizing those and so it's not like there's this this very mysterious match which we can never possibly encounter which is ever just beyond our reach we are actually in the world we're actually in it as it were and uh so in that regard Whitehead and bergson are both uh pushing back pretty hard against K now as for the Post contian German idealist that's where it gets a little bit more complicated because those guys are going to do things in a very similar way to the way that Whitehead and bergson do especially Hegel and shelling and and uh haiger later on they're going to kind of take K's basic presuppositions and then just run with them in a way that K didn't really anticipate and come to some very similar conclusions as those that burgon and Whitehead are going to come to for example just the the um ontological fundamental of Consciousness for example um that's there in basically everybody after K except for maybe fcta I think but regardless um you you see a very similar trajectory in the German idealist movement and so it's it's interesting because it's like if you take that German idealist movement and you just take it to its most logical extreme and then you take the um British analytic tradition that Whitehead was a part of and take it to its logical extreme uh you kind of end up in a very similar placed which is which is interesting it kind of implies that you know all all roads kind of lead to Rome at least some extent awesome uh speaking of Roads leading to the same place uh so so we could we can say that uh um hory burkson and Whitehead are pans psychist right they believe that the universe is conscious and in some manner as well as some of the other thinkers that you talked about like like Gerta perhaps um it seems that some Modern philosophers I don't know if you're familiar with this gayen straon published a journal and and in the uh Journal of Consciousness studies and and he he published an article titled um does materialism imply pans psychism uh and I know about this because Rupert sheldrake talks about it and he talks about how even just within a materialist world view you know how can UNC ious matter give birth to conscious beings which we are conscious beings right the only way you can escape that statement is If you deny Consciousness itself in which a lot of materialists people like Daniel dennet do they call it illusory or they might even say it's epiphenomenal uh but that obviously is not just doesn't seem to be a good explanation so to take that statement how can unconscious matter give birth to conscious beings uh we we can kind of flip it on its head and that's what this philosopher gayen strawson does he says what if Consciousness is more of a spectrum instead of unconscious matter and conscious it's it's more of like everything is conscious to a certain extent and that's kind of how it came about so what are your thoughts on that do you think materialism itself if you go far enough into it does it imply pans psychism yeah exactly and uh you see this um I'm not as familiar with gayen strawson's work but this is uh you know a tendency I think you see something very similar in um Daniel Dennett for sure and also chers it comes to similar conclusions for similar reasons and trying to be as empiricist as you possibly can or as materialist as you possibly can you end up kind of in the same place no matter what and and denett is a great example of this I think because in his book consciousness explained um D it really sets himself about the task of trying to rid Western analytic philosophy of Mind of the ghost in the machine as as Riley put it uh he's he he he thinks he set himself to task of just trying to exercise this latent dualism that he sees uh within analytic philosophy of mind and I think he's totally right about that by the way there is a latent dualism there uh but the problem is that latent dualism is epiphenomenalism and D sees this quite clearly actually whenever you try to conceptualize these things in such a way that you just start with dead matter and then somehow by organizing things in the right way you get the projection of a completely new metaphysical domain out of that um you're you are working with a kind of dualism the only difference is that in cartisian dualism you have two different kinds of fundamental substances which are both there from the beginning within this kind of Neo epiphenomenalist du M excuse me um it it's really just the same thing only you're trying to start with one and then get the other out of it but it's still dualism fundamentally and denn's right that that is certainly the case and um over the course of Consciousness explained denn uh goes to bat uh attacking this and his arguments are really good uh he makes some very compelling arguments that that kind of epiphenomenalism really just doesn't work and it doesn't and it's really there at the end though where you're like okay Dan you're GNA you're gonna actually come to the conclusion that you know you have to come to now right and he just kind of like waxes it's like he comes as close as he possibly can to the edge of the pool and then kind of like his toes in it and thenly Waddles back because he's not willing to go that far but because he knows if he does then suddenly all the the woooo and the pseudo scientists and the religious people might actually have a point about some things and he can't let them have that because there's intellectual enemies right so um but yeah point being yes if you go far enough starting from almost any any starting point really I think you you kind of have to end up with very similar conclusions about the nature of Consciousness and its relationship to existence in general yeah okay awesome great answer um so I want to move on now um to a different section now and I want to actually Trace back to one of the things that you mentioned this one was a little bit difficult for me to grasp at first but once I saw some of the evidence behind it it really it's fascinating um and I want to ask you what are your opinions on the idea that memories are not just stored as material traces uh but that exist Beyond uh just this physical body uh it's basically challenging this idea that minds are not just confined to brains what are some of the pieces of evidence maybe you could talk about that that would um elude or or point to this this idea uh well one of the the the first bits of evidence that we've had for over a hundred years now is that um there apparently are no on grams in the brain so in the the late 19th early 20th century uh scientists theorized that memories Were Somehow stored in patterns of neural circuitry or what have you and that somehow we retrieve our memories by reactivating those and so scientists began experimenting on this and they they um uh performed experiments uh on rats in which they basically taught the rats how to do things it develop memories uh uh within the rat's minds and then they went in and uh rather barbarically uh surgically uh I believe they cauterized different parts of the rat's brains trying to figure out where in the rat's brains the memories were and what they found is as long as you've got enough brain left for the rat to actually stay alive the memories can't be destroyed they're still there somehow so where are they and scientists ended up kind of concluding well they've got to be just like distributed somehow okay how um we know that certain parts of the brain do perform specific functions with regards to memory recollection I believe it's the hypothalamus which uh is concerned with um kind of the the um uh with episodic memories figuring out where and when specific memories occurred but we still don't know where the memories are and yet we we're still running with this presumption that um organic memory must be like computer memory that somehow there is this storage of memory um in a physical medium somehow um and uh Bergs of course concludes that this just absolutely cannot be the case it doesn't Accord with our actual experience of memory um and if you really think about it for a second like it that metaphor just doesn't really hold much water like the way that our memories operate um they're never corrupted in in the way that a comp computer memory is you never run out of storage space for memories rather what happens is when you've got a lot of memories that are very similar to one another and you don't have a specific event or feature to latch on to that can allow you to distinguish certain memories from others then they kind of tend to blur together in a way and we experience this all the time you probably can't tell me you where you were last Tuesday at 10:00 a.m. or whatever I can't either because the me I mean it all just kind of runs together unless there's a specific reason to distinguish things but all the information as far as we know is there there doesn't seem to be any upper limit whatsoever in uh how much memory a person can have um another bit of of evidence that's really interesting here is um the phenomenon of terminal Lucidity so patients with Alzheimer's uh will um of course lose uh their Clarity their Lucidity as the disease progresses they become increasingly unable to recognize people or to recall what year it is and all kinds of things like that and from the kind of neurop physicalist perspective it's like okay that's that's what's going on there there is a physical damage that's happening to the brain and the memories are being destroyed as a result of that but then you have terminal Lucidity where in the final moments of life Final hours or what have you for whatever reason um everything can just come back all of a sudden so if it was just destroyed right like I mean where where was it you know um and there's not a good answer uh for this within that kind of materialistic framework and so the conclusion which bergson and Shel Drake and and myself have come to and um and also Whitehead he doesn't say this explicitly because again he's kind of oriented more toward the future than the past in a lot of ways but you can see it kind of implicit at least um in his philosophy uh for sure that memory is is something that actually isn't just a specialized function that's performed by nervous systems in this kind of vaguely computationalist manner rather memory is a fundamental feature of nature as such the past itself is not annihilated as it moves away from us into the past and again if you're thinking about these things in a purely mechanistic manner then there's some very serious ontological ambiguity as to whether the past still even exists or not right because if you think of that every single event is is determined fully by the event that immediately preceded it then you've got all these other events that are way further in the past now where are they they don't matter anymore they're not in in the game they're just gone essentially uh bergson Whitehead sheld Drake you see this inv vestic ISM as well the idea of the akashic field the kosic record um there there's a total rejection of this um the the creative products of time the past is still very much alive and is still very much participating in the present and living systems in a lot of way you can understand living systems as particular um systems through which um the past is regenerated into the present brought into participation with the present in different ways right so for your your body for example you can think of in this way I believe it was Terrence McKenna who once said that if you think about the human being in a kind of metat temporal way you look at all the different little time slices kind of stacked along one another the human being would look like a kind of worm as it were right because it it would be like stretched through time so in a sense what you've got here is you've got a sequence of uh these these complex uh moments of organism which are all kind of strung together um and the thing that is doing that stringing together is memory all of that past um in some way or another is being made available through the continuity of the organism uh and so yeah um with regards to evidence for that though I mean we could look at rert sheld Drake's work we could look at just I mean the entire field of parapsychology um there's a lot of different threads that I think point to that being the case and when you start to look at it that way memory uh the actual phenomenon of memory starts to look just way more comprehensible than it does if you look at it through this more mechanistic mode where things just don't really add up the way that they should uh based on what that that view of things would would predict so yeah so one of the most fascinating examples I've come across was the work of Dr Michael Levan and his example of his plinary you know his flatworm plaria uh who where where he would cut this planaria in half and they regenerat into you know two different planarians no different than a magnet when you cut a magnet in half it doesn't turn into just a separate south and north but it turns into their own individual magnets with their own North and South so it was interesting how that similar effect happened within those pinari but what he he did these experiments where I saw that you it would trade the palarian to do some type of behavior um and and when he chopped out this pinan into maybe like up to 10 or more different pieces every each individual uhh uh planarian that would regenerate would retain that memory so you're cutting it off from its central nervous system and it's still retaining it so what is the glue that's holding that memory together um so what is the explanation he provides um is it is it electricity right so Levens really wishy-washy about this unfortunately he's trying well I mean in the position that he's in I mean the dudes at tough's University same it works right like okay he's trying to be as respectable hard science as he can about this so whenever um he's asked about the relationship between his ideas and this more woo woo stuff he's like well you know and he's kind of got to be that way yes but at the same time his own research is pushing further and further in that direction what Lan has said before is like okay well clearly the memories are not stored in a particular place so maybe they're in this kind of um implicate structure that's that's not necessarily in the actual organization of the parts but rather something that's at this kind of deeper organizational level um so he's drawing these ideas from from uh kind of like systems theory and and different ideas computation about um these kind of uh implied meta organizational structures I don't think that really works but regardless uh again his own research is pushing further and further to the inescapability of these conclusions so one thing that I found out about um after I did my video on shell Drake which is the one where I really talked about his uh experiments um I uh was listening to him talk about some of the the the more recent research that he's done and uh so we already mentioned the the stuff with the planarians right so you cut these planarians into as many bits as you want they seem to retain their memories you can also take these planarians you can cut them in half and without changing their DNA whatsoever um you can induce these macro level uh well macr mutations as they say right by depolarizing the uh the wound the ision Point uh and thus kind of tricking the organism's morphogenetic field to regenerate a second head rather than a tail and then when that organism reproduces you get more two-headed planarians now you could argue at this point okay but the planarians reproduce by binary fion they literally tear themselves in half so maybe it's just carrying over onto The Offspring Michael Lev's very clever though so here's what he did uh he started doing this thing where um you can kind of Frankenstein these planarians together where you can take like a piece of one and kind of incorporate it into a regenerating planarian and it'll just kind of like scoop up that extra matter and make one organism because you got think they're all clones right so it's it's it's actually not that difficult to achieve that with an organism like that so uh what you can do you can take your two-headed planarians again no change in DNA needed whatsoever and take a piece of one and incorporate it into a regular planarian with one head and then when that planarian reproduces there's a certain probability that its Offspring will have two heads instead of one so where's the two-headed right right so again it gets it gets weird harder and harder to explain this without invoking these uh more uh let's say ontologically substantial ideas about memory and nature and about morphogenetic fields and I think that ultimately that's that's going to be inescapable and honestly Levan might not be on the same page with me on this but it seems to me like he's intentionally angling for that because when he was talking about this he was talking about how a lot of uh researchers presumed that these regenerative capacities were mediated by stem cells and so um if if that's what he thought was going on then presumably uh he he would have have uh pursued the research in that direction but what he did is he uh used radiation he irradiated the planarians after they were cut in half to kill all of their stem cells to show that when they they regenerate the second head and whatnot it's not the stem cells that are doing it oh it's it's elsewhere and so it's like it seems like if doing that like he kind of sees where this is going but anyway that's that's me reading into it that's not him talking so yeah okay that's that's actually genius the way he organized those experiences seems that's that's wow that's phenomenal um okay so what what is bioelectricity then I know he uses that term a lot is it just can we can we invoke that because I I'll tell you what I want to get into organ transplants and M but I've spoken to are you familiar with Dr Jack Cruz um on the internet okay so he's basically he's this neurosurgeon and he is big into he calls it quantum biology and he basically just really hammers hard into the physics of of the organism and and and looking at Health through the lens of physics and even quantum physics so he basically says that um that water itself can retain uh a memory uh and this is somehow affected by the electromagnetic fields that are emitted you know within within an organism and he points to this scientist named Luke Monier are you familiar with with his work or his experiment um okay okay so Luke montin did this Amazing Experiment where he recapitulated DNA just by um doing something like like um manipulating the electromagnetic fields of of within a system and changing the structure of of water um I'm not I'm really butchering this to be honest yeah it's really interesting I'm not getting the experiment exactly right but it's something analogous to that so is that similar to the idea of bioelectricity that I'm that the electromagnetic frequencies could affect maybe the structure of water and maybe hold some type of memory is that kind of yeah so there's a lot going on here I think and this is something that I've really been pursuing a lot lately I am not a physic so this is not exactly my forte but uh it's something I've been really trying to delve into because it definitely seems like there are these very fascinating connections here between electricity and plasma and the nature of life um most uh physicists will tell you that electricity is just a purely mechanistic phenomenon it just behaves in these you know predictable ways we have our equations we know how it works Works um but there's some really mysterious things about electricity and I feel like as electricity becomes incorporated into these more complex systems you you get spookier and spookier things going on um and even at the more basic level with something like water you could have some really spooky things going on potentially so with regards to Levan's work in particular though so he talks a lot about bioelectricity and uh within the context of his um experimental research and theoretical ideas um he's conceptualizing this in terms of patterns of electrical gradients between cell membranes which is to say that you've essentially got a kind of blueprint sort of um within the the um the electrical gradients between the cells which is to say that an individual cell kind of knows whether it needs to reproduce or not reproduce or differentiate in a certain way or undergo apoptosis or what have you on the basis of the neighboring cells and the kind of like ion exchange relationships there and so that is a kind of a electricity because those are are all on the basis of positive and negative charge it's it's electrical right so um yeah you've got that going on but I really feel like that's probably U ultimately going to be revealed to just be kind of something very surface level actually because even looking at it that way even like when you look at the whole organism and and you can see that kind of pattern there within those electrical gradients you still got to ask the question well where did that pattern come from um and if it's not the DNA then you know what is it right so yeah there's some Mysteries here I think there's definitely some deep connections between these ideas of electrom magnetism and plasma and the idea of morphogenetic fields that hopefully uh will be able to tease out more in the future but just to kind of uh tease that a little bit if we go to Whitehead's ideas for example his idea of conceptual prehensions and these mental poles so I I said before that we can conceptualize those as fields of possibility um so look at an atom this way for example you the atomic nucleus and it's it's got its thing going on and then you've got this so-called electron orbital shell um in which the way it's described in physics books as well there's an electron but it has nonlocalities so this electron which is somehow a wave and a particle but neither is kind of in all those different positions at the same time but then when you make some kind of interaction event happen then it's at one particular place and then and I guess it goes back to being in this non-locality state the coherent State as they call it it's all like what you know I'm sure the equations work I'm not going to contest that necessarily but the explanations for what's going on here are very convoluted and um but but but through this more whiteheadian perspective what's going on actually seems very clear the um field the the electron orbital shells are distributions of possible events and then what we're calling the electron is not an enduring physical or quasi physical object that that endures over time it's just an event right so when when you detect the electron what's really happening is is you're you're taking a distribution of possible electronic events and then boom you've got an actual electronic event which is drawn from that cloud of potentiality right so you don't need any particles to both be there and not be there magically at the same time so anyway um the the the relationship here then to electricity is that if um electrons or any kind of of quantum entities are that we don't have particles uh and and Fields what we have are fields of possible events and then we have the events right so so if that is the case then those fields are morphogenetic Fields they they I would argue are ontologically the exact same thing as the morphogenetic fields that are causing those plorans to do what they do within uh Michael Len's experiments yeah so what that then implies is that really um the morphogenetic fields of more complex organisms are just kind of holons which are are created through the weaving together of these kind of micro level morphogenetic fields and at the micro level they are electromagnetic so at the macro level you would expect electromagnetism to be playing a very significant role as well so yeah okay awesome and let's touch a little bit now on on the organ transplants because Dr Jack Cruz I've spoken to him and he told me about the story um about him doing an organ transplant or a patient in which uh they replaced their heart completely they did a heart transplant surgery and the person who uh had taken their heart and and went the person who died and they took their organ right they they uh were in a car crash and they were eating McDonald's french fries and then the the scene of the crash he had french fries all over him and yeah this is the way he describes it so they take his heart and put it into this new patient and this new patient has no idea about what happened to this person and she comes back months later after the heart transplant to Dr Cruz and says uh doc I have a problem like it's a really it's really an issue uh ever since I got my heart transplant I have this severe craving for McDonald's frenchise now that's just like an anecdote it's a story but I I personally really trust the word of Dr Jack Cruz and I I I trust that that story is is true and he's talked about it multiple times um I just thought it was so interesting and I couldn't help but think but that's morphic resonance right there when I first encountered it and then I saw some of your videos where you talk about a little bit about organ transplants could you maybe talk a little bit about some of those stories if you if you remember them um of the maybe some similar things happening where memories being retained in those organs yeah I mean we have no reason to believe whatsoever that these patients are lying about their experiences that I mean again experience is is if you're an empiricist experience is what you're starting with and experiences are always going to be subjective and then in subjective and then we slap that honorary objective on them once we feel like we've really latched onto something that's real um but yeah um this is this should be treated as data because it's not just one person saying things like this there are there are many accounts like this of organ transplants particularly heart transplants uh resulting in um apparently transferred memories weird idiosyncrasies in terms of like aversions or Cravings things like that paranoia uh there's um a lot going on there and it I mean it's not really possible to handwave this away there's there's quite a bit of medical literature about it now now um the materialist explanation for this of course is just one handwave or another well there's neurons in the heart um there's not many really yeah there's not there's not enough it would seem to have complex memories and then you got to ask questions about like well if the memories are in the heart and not the brain then why is that or is it like that it's somehow the brain's making its memories in the brain and like duplicating them in the heart and yeah I mean it getss complicated very quickly but if we look at this in terms of morphic resonance then what's going on here is you don't need complex stored memories to be transferred from one patient to the other within the organ all that needs to be transferred from point A to point B is the kind of seed as it were the the the the ability to um tune into that memory as it were because the memory is itself is actually stored in the past and the way that that past is then reiterated in the present is uh through what sheld calls morphic resonance which I think is identical to what Whitehead is calling hybrid prehension it is the way in which these mental poles these morphogenetic fields are able to influence one another uh in a way that's not localized in the same way that mechanical efficient causation is is uh the physicist David bone came to very similar conclusions he he actually um was influenced by sheld Drake and Whitehead and he developed this idea of an implicate order uh which I think is very uh crucial here because it's essentially the idea that these morphogenetic fields um they correspond to physically spatio temporally localized bodies in the explicit world the physical world as bone would say um but in themselves they they are they are implicate and what he means by that is that they are all kind of in one another within this Singularity where influence between them is not a matter of um extension like whether objects are close to each other or not it's a matter of uh the the formative similarity so the the morphogenetic proximity proximity Within thin morphogenetic space rather than physical extensive space and uh so yeah you take that idea and you run with it and things get weird really quick and uh but in really fascinating ways yeah go ahead no no sorry I was just laughing because yeah that's it's it's so cool yeah is it cutting out I know it's it for just a second I think we're good though yeah okay sorry about that yeah it's probably mine um yeah we're what what you're saying um you're you're talking about morphic resonance being um this relationship in similarity the way sheld talks about it which is so F it's so outside like modern scientific thought but it's it's so fascinating yeah you you were saying yeah and so and and again if we look at Michael lean's work it's just like I don't know I find it hard to believe that he doesn't see that as where it's going because he talks about what he calls morphogenetic spaces which are exactly what what I was just implying this idea that you can think of um morphogenetic processes is existing within this kind of landscape if you really wanted it to be accurate it couldn't just be like a two-dimensional or even threedimensional landscape because there are just so many things going on here but again you can think of it as a space a kind of hyperdimensional space and things processes can be closer together or further away within that space now this would be the uh similarity based influence that uh sheld talks about that uh when these uh processes are closer together and more similar morphogenetically then there's going to be a greater influence between them and that influence is going to um essentially operate as a kind of um Shel calls it an automatic averaging you can think of the metaphor of like a composite image um of different images being imposed upon one another right and so what's happening here is um any kind of Developmental processes are going to take certain pathways through morphogenetic space um you start with an embryo and there's a lot of different creatures that could come from that embryo and so there has to something there that's kind of guiding that developmental process or even your body right now your your body isn't changing very much but it's got to know how to repeat itself you know it's got to be it's constantly regenerating um and so the idea here is that this morphic resonance then is essentially kind of carving out the the developmental pathway that these organic processes follow and again there's all kinds of implications here for memory and Paras pychology and uh spiritual experiences and organ transplants and really just everything yeah okay um how you talked about this a little bit in one of your videos how does Stephen J Gould in his idea of punctuated equilibrium within evolution by the way that guy was seeing as like a heretic as well a heretic like he was like yeah an outcast um because of because of this idea um how does it relate to morphic residence or morphic morphogenetic Fields I think it could potentially so uh Stephen J Gould was um a very influential uh paleontologist and and evolutionary theorist during the 70s 80s and then I believe he died in the early 90s sometime in the I believe but anyway uh him and and Richard Dawkins were like Arch nemeses essentially and um Dawkins went to bat for this kind of doctrine of gradualism the idea that these evolutionary processes have to increment ver bya via very tiny steps over time and uh Gould um was really just much more of an empiricist about it because he was saying look if we actually look at the fossil record you don't see that you see jumps being made and and the Dawkin sonian argument was well that's just because the fossil record's incomplete and the reason Dawkins was so insistent about this and and why many of Dawkins uh followers were so insistent about this was uh because within the neod darwinian Paradigm there are theoretical reasons why you should believe that that gradualism should be the case and it and it deals with um a kind of morphogenetic landscape in a way they call it a fitness landscape and essentially it's a kind of metaphor you can think of it as a landscape and it has Hills and the vertical access then corresponds to evolutionary Fitness so the higher up your an organism is uh on that landscape the closer it is to the peak of one of those Hills the more genetically fit it is so the argument goes something like this if you have any big mutations those are going to be far more likely to have a detriment effect on the organism's Fitness than not um because again you the bigger the mutation that's going to kind of you can think of it as Circle kind of expanding outward from the organism and so there's going to be more room in that space for valleys essentially where the mutation just kills the organism essentially or makes it so that it can't reproduce or is detrimental in some kind of way whereas if you have tiny mutations then it's going to be much more likely that your organism just kind of inches itself a little bit more towards the top of the hill and so theoretically then it should be that only micr mutations uh play a significant role in evolution and uh really this was a a battle of abstraction versus empiricism Dawkins was arguing from a purely abstract theoretical perspective Gould was arguing from the actual fossil record and if we look at uh This morphogenetics research now what that might imply about this I think it weighs very heavily in Gold's favor uh so some of uh Levan's research for example has been about um reorganizing embryonic cells and uh he's done a number of different things with this so first of all there are the xenobots where he he took the embryonic dermal cells from tadpole embryos and then just kind of artificially brought them together so that they began to form uh these uh he calls them xenobots and they're essentially these little balls of cells that can move around and eat and grow and reproduce and like most of the things that you would expect an organism to be able to do but this is very problematic from a Neo darwinian perspective because those little artificial organisms don't exist in nature they only exist due to human intervention so what the hell is programming them to do those things right they've never existed before the natural selection has had no time to act upon those organisms to make them behave the way they do they just do it somehow so somehow that's just in there right another experiment related to this would be what he did with uh Tad Tad poles where he uh essentially surgically um uh rearranged the eyes of the tadpole such that the eyes were uh the the what do you call it the optical nerve was connecting to the spine instead of going directly into the brain so in most organisms that's how it works the eyes do not go through the spinal cord the signals are sent directly into the brain and so the idea was well um if we if we rearrange it in this way will the tadpoles be able to see where will they be able to figure out how to use that information coming from those eyes the eyes are working just fine but will they be able to decipher that now that the information is going through their spinal cord instead of the regular trajectory and what they found was yes those Tad poles can see in fact which implies that even with something like that where there's no point in evolutionary history where the ancestors of those organisms had eyes that were sending signals through the spinal column that just didn't happen ever and yet they're able to figure it out so what does that imply for this whole gold versus Dawkins thing what it seems to imply then is that macrom mutations actually might be far more viable than Dawkins gave them credit for because no matter where a Mac macrom mutation might land an organism within its Fitness landscape that organism because it is a purposefully self-organizing system can just climb up the damn hill right and so a macr mutation let's say you've got two Fitness Hills right and you've got one over here in your your population of organisms and then you've got another Hill um the darwinian the Neo darwinian rather I should say uh the Daw andonian would argue the only way to get from point A to point B is for the fitness landscape itself to move or for an extremely unlikely macr mutation to send uh an organism from the Apex of one Hill to the apex of the next one what Levan's research seems to suggest that even if you got a mutation that lands the organism somewhere over here and no man's land as long as it's able to continue doing its thing then it can potentially reorganize its own physiology in relations to its environment in order to continue surviving and reproducing which means it can actually get to that other Hill um even if the mutation itself is initially something that would seem to be very detrimental yeah and it makes evolution purposive it's not this blind process it's not the blind watchmaker like Dawkins BL and it's not blind and there are no watches yeah that's what I say yeah so you you use this phrase absolutely amazing phrase I think one of your videos I don't where you got it maybe it was from you or someone else you said the dreaming Gardener as opposed to the blind watch watch maker was that you or yeah that was me I I don't know maybe somebody else has said that I don't think so I'm pretty sure that's that's that's a great that's a great line I'm I'm I'mma use that yeah um okay just uh we have time I think for just one more kind of section this will be the end um I know let's let's talk a little bit about the scientific dogma and some push back against these ideas and it's pretty much encapsulated um in this video that you created you created you I had this video it's two hours long it's uh titled how science became unscientific in which you detail a lot of these unscientific practices that the scientists themselves or the scientific worldview ENT tals but and then you got this response from Professor Davey who is a YouTuber I'm very familiar with you know he's a great guy he has some great explanation videos on his on his channel uh but he he took this position of immediately trying to mock you and it it's it's like the most ad hominum thing you could imagine right it's not all maybe some of his points were valid right but when you just go fullon ad homy with people I've had this critique of him before in the past even with people that I I were were supporting him and on his side um he just kind of loses his cool anyways that's my opinion on him but what's your opinion on that whole I don't want to call it beef but um Skirmish let's call it or that that kind of back and forth you you guys had well I think this is a great example of uh what we kind of opened with with this conversation which is the way that scientific ideology can potentially come to form uh come to play a very ideological and um really a kind of spiritualistic role but in a way that it kind of obfuscates itself and people don't realize that's what they're doing so with people like Dave uh and this is I I don't know Dave I don't know what his history is but I can make some educated guesses because I know quite bit about what people like that tend to be like people who are very hardliners for the kind of scientific materialism worldview people like uh Dan Barker Michael Shermer Susan Blackmore blah blah blah blah blah generally speaking you see a similar pattern with these people they start off as very kind of bright-eyed bushy tailed idealists they either have a religious upbringing or something along those lines then as they mature usually in their teens to early 20s they have a crisis of Faith which just shatters their worldview they feel so betrayed by it it's very traumatic for them because they just can't believe in the thing anymore and um in trying to get away from dogmatism uh they end up discovering science and they're like oh wow now I can be right about the thing you know and so the way I describe it is kind of like this you know Carl Young has this very um very appropriate statement he says that if you do not make the contents of the unconscious conscious then they will rule your life and you will call them fate and this is a perfect example of this because what's happening here is you have people like that who have a very very strong religious impulse they really want to believe in something they really want to be certain and right want to have a team that they can fight for but because of that kind of disillusionment they went through what happens is they kind of force that impulse down but instead of getting away from it what happens is it just kind of manifests in a way that it disguises itself as something else so the way I I've said it before is like you you you try to get away from the unconscious but you you can't get away from it it just goes behind the curve curtain puts on a fake mustache and a pair of glasses comes around the other side and shakes your hand and you're none the wiser and that's how it goes with these people because they end up um really being extremely religious fundamentalists about the these these ideas of like established science uh and whatnot and that you know some people would frame that as though it's bad because it's a religious impulse and and I don't really think of it that way I think the problem here isn't that there's an element of religiosity or spirituality here the the pathological potentially pathological aspect of this is that it's obfuscated the fact that people who are doing that don't realize they're doing it because to them it's just like no no no no I'm just you know I'm just spewing the facts that's that's all I care about this is just purely objective truth that I care about there's no ideological spiritualistic stuff here to see it's it's just the facts Dawkins says something like this he's he's actually said before a rather ridiculous statement that um you we shouldn't talk about belief in evolution because you don't have to believe in a fact you just accept a fact so look at that reframing then it's it's not believing in something it's you're either accepting it or you're a denialist right you're a heretic right and yeah so you see these exact same features that we associate with religious fundamentalism popping up in almost the exact same way using a slightly different language and uh it's very common these days I mean uh you know we're we're in a world where we like 23 24 years removed from the September 11th attacks that was a really big watershed moment for um the Western World certainly may maybe just the the you know Global civilization itself because it it really um laid the groundwork for a period of time in which people were very very disillusioned with spirituality and religiosity as such because there was kind of two major responses certainly in the United States at least with regards to that one was okay it's because Islam is bad and Christianity is good and usually those people were pushing a very kind of yeah Christian nationalist type agenda so people who push back against that they didn't really have a nuanced way of responding to that so their response was no no no no it's not that Islam is bad and Christianity is good it's that all religion is bad and science is good okay and so that really worked its way in into um the collective culture for quite a while and uh even today you see a lot of young people uh who who are drawn to that but what's interesting though is that for a lot of the young people today it's not something that they're drawn to because they're running away from a more um a more adolescent sense of of religiosity for them it like is that adolescent sense of religiosity because that's it's what they're given as part of their upbringing essentially be really interesting to see that Dynamic play out when those kids get a little older and then they start becoming disillusioned in the same way that my generation got disillusioned about religion back in like 2010 or whatever you know so because yeah it's just going to play itself out in a slightly different way and it's fun to watch also kind of horrifying in some way yeah yeah it's a roller coaster for sure um yeah there's this awesome quote that reminds me of everything you just said by Whitehead himself he said every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics what he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized so I just that's a mic drop right there I mean oh yeah absolutely that's that's that's an amazing one uh I just want to squeeze one more question and this this will be the end um do you think that nihilism is a byproduct um of of this materialist belief what I what I mean by that is I I in one point in my life was like like I would say maybe towards an atheist materialist uh um kind had this this belief and I just kind of had this subjective feeling of being very empty and sad and nihilistic and I've I've changed a lot since then but with these ideas this idea that the universe is is alive and is conscious and there's more to discover it really brings me a sense of joy that I just I don't think I really back in those days when I had that that um old belief system so I I'm wondering do you have you experienced maybe a similar thing um and yeah yeah so the thing about a more scientific rationalist position is at least it maintains some kind of meaning or at least it tries to because it it it weaves this kind of meta Narrative of Enlightenment technoscientific progress so you the idea is something like this we were all naked starving barbarians dirty beating each other with sticks and the Paleolithic and then gradually we developed Technologies and we got smarter and then we slowly shed the vestiges of superstition and religiosity until we got to the point that we're at now and that will just continue into the future technology will solve all our problems and then we'll have some kind of Star Trek quasi socialist Utopia um and that works for some people I mean some people go there entire lives believing that but there are some pretty big cracks in it for for a number of reasons um the main one being if once you back up from it a little bit and you're going okay well what's the point right and there's not really a good answer to that it's it's really a worldview that can only hold together in so far as it has an opponent to defeat and typically the opponent they feel themselves trying to defeat is you know the religious fundamentalists or the new agers or you know whoever but once you forget about those people for a while and you're just left with that belief system you're just like you know this kind of sucks actually like because there's very little there it's very insubstantial everything uh if you really start to follow it to its logical conclusions just looks like these completely nihilistic power rations you keep following that threat a little bit and then you're you're suddenly realizing that um you know that worldview hardly even has any room for the the idea of scientific truth because it hardly has any room for an idea of objective Truth at all and uh yeah this can spiral into a a very you know devastating nihilism if if it's if it's followed through to its logical conclusion I think which is why I think we're seeing such a massive Resurgence of interest in more spiritualistic ideas more far out ideas right now because again it's been 24 years is since uh the the the seeds of that um uh materialistic atheist worldview were laid within popular culture at least prior to that it was more of an academic intellectual thing most people were just kind of casually religious uh let's say but it was during that little 20-year period that people Ordinary People really got to try out that world view in their ordinary lives apart from Academia and what we're seeing right now I think is is that this kind of on mass realization uh gradual albeit that uh it just doesn't work it it you know you need a worldview that actually gives you a way to orient yourself towards reality and to deal with other people and to deal with yourself and to make sacrifices and to figure out when it's appropriate to make sacrifices and when you need to plant your flag in the mud and and you know let them come at you if you don't if you don't have a substantial framework for contextualizing those things then you're just kind of lost and you're never sure um whether you even have good reasons for what you're doing so yeah awesome well thank you so much keelen for coming on this was amazing like I I learned so much I'd love to have you on again I I have like a whole two two more pages of questions um but I just yeah I wanted to make sure yeahh awesome so um yeah thank you for coming on any any last remarks you want to leave with the audience with uh nothing nothing too substantial or theoretical just glad to be here um if uh y'all want to check out my YouTube channel again that's forescape forcapil on the weekends we're going to be uh doing some courses going over a few books y'all can go over there and check out exactly what we going on exactly what we got going on and uh yeah that'll about do it thank you so much for having me on you had great questions and super fun conversation we should totally do it again sometime have a good have a good one man see you take care

[Music] obviously astrology has much to offer psychology but what the latter can offer its elder sister is less evident so far as I can judge it would seem to me advantageous for astrology to take take the existence of psychology into account above all the psychology of the personality and of the unconscious Carl Young in this video we are going to be talking about astrology and this video is intended to be directed primarily towards two different groups of people the first audience I wish to address here consists of those who just don't really know much about astrology or who are very skeptical or dismiss of astrology if the only contact a person has ever had with astrology is through memes tabloid horoscopes or casual references to Sun Signs then it's rather understandable that such a person would assume that there's nothing of substance within the world of astrology which is worth their time in addition to the superficial pop cultural depictions of astrology there's also the tendency of regarding astrology as a pseudo science and in fact in fact it is rather common for astrology to be presented as the Paradigm example of pseudo science and therefore as a field which can be safely dismissed as irrelevant and fanciful nonsense even researchers who study ancient mythology or religions often times completely ignore astrology due to this taboo despite how immensely significant astrology has been in shaping our understandings of the world for the vast majority of human history for individuals who have internalized this perception of astrology my intention here is to show that in reality astrology is a staggeringly rich and nuanced topic which is of direct relevance to anyone who has interest in the studies of religion mythology symbolism and philosophy and by extension the study of the human psyche and the historical journey through which the human psyche has come to develop the compositional morphology which we see in the modern world regarding astrology as a pseudo science is about as sensible as regarding music as a form of pseudo cake baking or regarding comparative mythology as a form of pseudo chemistry there are certain Elements which are shared between astrology and natural science but in general it is both philosophically inappropriate and intellectually dis honest to dismiss the psychological cultural and historical significance of astrology by comparing astrology to modern mechanistic science for now I will be bracketing the question of whether or not astrology itself can be predictive or whether or not there could be a naturalistic explanation for the synchronicities which astrologers study these are topics which we will return to later on in this video but for now we will be looking at a astrology primarily in terms of psychology mythology and metaphysics my second target audience then consists of those who are familiar with the modern practice of astrology but who may be less familiar with the relationships between astrology and the subjects of Mythology metaphysics or psychodynamic theories as is usual with my video essays I will be doing quite a bit of my own Theory crafting along the way and I hope that even those who are well versed in astrology will find my analyses here to be interesting and worthy of consideration the significance of astrology in early human history cannot be overstated across virtually all human civilizations across the globe archaeologists find that ancient peoples constructed their megalithic structures in accordance with features of the celestial realm the Abu simel Temple complex of Egypt for example believed to have been constructed during the 13 Century BC during the reign of pharaoh ramsy II was constructed such that on October 22nd and February 22nd of each year rays of the sun would enter the temple and illuminate all of the sculptures on the Temple's back wall except for the Statue of t a god associated with the realm of the Dead the chichin eats a step pyramid of Mexico believed to have been constructed between the 8th and 10th centuries ad is constructed in such a way that during the Spring and fall equinoxes a shadow is created which depicts the serpent form of the deity Ketel coddle the shadow serpent is seen to descend the steps of the pyramid thus bringing the celestial and terrestrial Realms of the world into Union but the astrological nature of human spirituality is far older than recorded history and far older than human civilization as we typically understand that term the ples star cluster known by modern astronomy as Messier 45 is referred to as the Seven Daughters of Atlas within Greek mythology within indic mythology the ples are referred to as the seven mothers in Japanese mythology the ples are referred to as nanatsu bosi meaning Seven Stars within Aboriginal Australian mythology we again see the ples referred to as the Seven Sisters throughout these various mythological traditions we find several consistent core motifs the stars are typically regarded as Seven Sisters within narratives that often involve the sisters being pursued and one of the sisters being kidnapped or missing the similarities seen in these disperate mythic Traditions are striking and this has led some researchers to conclude that these commonalities must be due to a common origin if that were the case then that would imply that this Mythic truth tradition must be older than the divergences of these different cultures the myth itself in other words must have existed before humans branched out so as to inhabit these disperate regions of the Earth this might then suggest that this myth is a common inheritance that we modern Homo sapiens brought with us when we migrated Out of Africa some 100,000 years ago assuming of course that the Out of Africa migration hypothesis is in fact correct interestingly despite the fact that there are indeed Seven Stars within the Messier 45 star cluster only six are visible to the human eye in the present day as two of the stars are so close in proximity that they appear as a single object within the night sky however these stars were further apart and thus visibly distinguishable in the distant past research has indicated that around 100 100,000 years ago the ples would have been discernible as seven separate Stars within the night sky the relationship between human beings and the celestial realm is one which is immensely ancient and perhaps even as old as Humanity itself as we can see this tradition has always been one of immense spiritual significance there was little to no distinction in ancient cultures between astrology astronomy and priesthood as the study of the celestial realm was understood as identical with the study of the Gods the world itself was seen to be animated by meaning and the celestial realm was seen to be the embodiment of the compositional structures through which these meanings gave shape to the terrestrial realm the movements of the heavens were seen as the purposive movements of a transcendental order and the significations which were seen within these patterns were regarded very seriously by all human cultures throughout the world for the vast majority of human history religion culture and astrology were of an indivisible Unity it is of course very common to regard such an understanding of the world as superstitious nonsense we tend to believe that such an understanding is unscientific and to have been superseded by our modern materialistic worldview those who are dismissive of astrology will often claim that astrology must be nonsense because there is no causal mechanism through which celestial objects could impact human beings or human societies again causality is something I want to return to later on in this video but for now I want to instead look at this issue from a yungan psycho dnamic perspective although even jungians themselves tend to neglect this fact Carl Young himself studied and wrote about astrology and used astrological charts in his psychotherapeutic practice as he saw astrological patterns as a window into the patterns which he sought within the unconscious inner worlds of his patients Yung stated that astrology was quote the sum of all psychical knowledge of antiquity in order to understand why Yung saw so much significance in astrology even while many of his colleagues regarded it as fanciful Superstition we must first look at astrology in terms of collective Consciousness rather than in terms of mechanical causation even if there is no impersonal causal Force by which distant planets or Stars might impact the human psyche in a mechanistic way it is nonetheless the case that the human psyche itself is a kind of superorganism which has evolved over the course of human history as figures like Carl Young Joseph Campbell Robert Moore and James Hillman have shown us the collective psyches of distinct human cultures and human civilizations at large are populated by archetypal motifs primordial images and complex networks of signification which have developed dynamically over the course of human history prehistory and even evolution evolutionary history it could be therefore that the causal relationships between human beings and the celestial processions are simply human eyes as we repeatedly look to the heavens over the course of innumerable epochs we wo the processions of the heavens into our narratives about who we are and what the world is through the very practice of doing astrology the celestial procession would have come to be engraved as it were within the deepest strata of our psychical makeup we correlated patterns within our terrestrial world with patterns in the heavens and through doing so patterns within our Collective psyche would have come to reflect the patterns within the celestial realm even if there were no other causal relationship even now in the modern world in which far fewer people look to that Heavens in this way these patterns may be continuing to play themselves out whether we profess to believe in such patterns or not as we delve deeper we will be looking at some of the evidence which could be indicative that such patterns are indeed at work within our world but in order to properly understand and contextualize such evidence we must begin with a general understanding of what the astrological archetypes actually are how they relate to one another and how these archetypes correspond to the contents of the human psyche and to the basic compositional elements of the natural world more generally here we will begin with the planetary archetypes and specifically with the inner planets which were visible to the uned human eye throughout the vast majority of human history these planetary bodies are the moon the Sun Mercury Venus Mars Jupiter and Saturn for the vast majority of human history these celestial bodies were the visible manifestations of the Gods with each body signifying a distinct and complex personality through the processions of the celestial realm these archetypes were seen to come into Dynamic interplay with one another and thereby enact the continual generation of the visible terrestrial world shown here is an approximately 34,000 year- old bone carving discovered in dorone France and attributed to the upper Paleolithic or ignation culture this is perhaps the oldest known example of writing which has ever been uncovered by archaeologists and what we see here is a highly sophisticated lunar calendar which accurately depicts the processions of lunar cycles some researchers believe that such lunar calendars were used by prehistoric peoples as a means of tracking human menstrual cycles and therefore would have been used as a means of facilitating fertility or for preventing pregnancy in times of scarcity as this example illustrates the moon's archetypal associations with pregnancy childbirth Parenthood blood relations and the mystical life generative powers of the feminine are immensely ancient these Association ations are far from arbitrary human menstrual cycles are approximately the same duration as lunar cycles and therefore regularities of the former could be correlated with regularities of the latter by ancient peoples our modern words Moon month and menstration share the same eological roots and such correlations are found throughout numerous human languages some Modern scientific research also indicates that there could be direct correlations between lunar cycles and menstration cycles for some women at least during certain time periods and such correlations are not limited to humans corals for example have been shown to spawn in conjunction with lunar cycles as well fundamentally the archetype of the moon seems to be that of inheritance broadly speaking within various cultures throughout the world we see that the Moon is consistently ass associated with fertility Parenthood kinship and relations to ancestral Spirits these are relations through which the past comes to regenerate itself within the present the Moon is often associated with forms of magic which similarly invoke the spiritual powers of the past even in modern language we often refer to rumination as reflection though we often Overlook the invocation of the lunar archetype with in such manners of speaking the moon reflects the light of the sun into the night and likewise the lunar archetype allows the nocturnal past to be revealed within the light of presently living Consciousness the Moon is associated with the substance silver which is associated with Purity for cultures which emphasize the reliable inheritance of the past and thus the conservation of the inherited social order the concept of Purity is of central significance the relationship between the past and future is often regarded as a kind of river and deviations from social norms tend to be regarded as contaminations which bring forth disease and death such emphasis on inheritance Purity and social adherence is perhaps exemplified most thoroughly by Chinese civilization within Chinese culture the Moon is often more highly regarded than any other Celestial body as the Moon is associated with Purity and familial bonds during the age of sale the Chinese Empire would only accept silver as payment for trade goods as the Chinese regarded silver as of much greater value than gold this association between silver and lunar Purity is also more than merely symbolic as the substance silver has very real antibiotic otic properties and an extensive history of medical uses next we have the sun while the Moon is correlated with the relations of past and present the sun conversely can be correlated with relations of present and future and more specifically with the aims or teleological attractors Which pull the world forward as it were unto the realization of the future within both ancient and modern astrology the sun is often said to represent the will the agency of an individual which moves us through time towards the realization of possibilities understood in teleological terms we can see the will as consisting of ideals teoy or attractors which serve as The Guiding Light Of Consciousness the highest values which serve as a center of gravity for our personal or Collective agencies and the center of narrative gravity within our personal and Collective myths solar attractors or values are the light which our Consciousness casts upon the world and we can see this relationship between valuation and disclosure quite clearly within the works of the cognitive scientist John Veri much of verve's work is centered upon what he calls relevance realization and within this work Veri has shown the ways in which human cognition is inextricably interwoven with structures of meaning and valuation the world which our Consciousness encounters is not one of raw data which we then evaluate after the fact rather REI tells us our cognition of the world as a world at all is necessarily itself a process of evaluating relevance and such relevance must be understood in terms of implicit or explicit values it is only through such values that the human mind is able to experience a world at all rather than a mere melstrom of Senseless noise what the psychologist William James might have called a blooming buzzing confusion within the Christian tradition the figure of Christ is in many ways a kind of solar deity we can see Christ's Halo as a symbolic coraly of the solar Corona Christ represents the living embodiment of the will of God the cosmic logos which animates reality itself Christ is therefore the enactment within human life of the most ultimate value the self-sacrificial and World generative love which in previous videos I have described as a will unto be being or a will Unto numinosity the Sun is associated with the substance gold which is regarded as the physical embodiment of value itself like transcendental ideals which are seen to exist beyond the vicissitudes of the natural world gold does not tarnish or rust within medieval Alchemy the project of transmuting lead into gold was seen to mirror the spiritual quest of spiritual life ing the human mind and body through the process of theosis next we have the planet Mercury the closest planet to the Sun as well as the fastest moving Planet within helenic mythology Mercury is the messenger of the Gods and is often identified with the mystical figure Hermes Tris magistus and the Egyptian god th Mercury is an archetype of communication language writing thought and wisdom much as the moon mediates between the Sun and the nocturnal terrestrial Realm of the past Mercury mediates between the Sun and the other Celestial archetypes the processes of Mercurial thought are what allows the celestial realm of pure forms and ideas to be organized in relation to the cosmic purposiveness represented by the solar center of teleological gravity fundamentally Mercury is ideational consciousness or noasis the metallic substance known as mercury or Quicksilver also embodies such archetypal significations Quicksilver is metallic and thus reflective yet a liquid which is able to rapidly change shape just as thought is able to reflect the world and mold it self into accordance with the world of the imagination ancient and medieval Mystery Schools revered Mercurial deities such as th and Hermes Tris Magistas because thought was seen to be the means by which the human psyche was able to take flight and thereby reunite with a transcendental realm of forms deities or Angels the planet Venus the Queen of Heaven repres present the archetype of symbiosis and harmonization the bringing together of the disperate elements of the world into communion with one another so as to create novelty and Beauty Venus is associated with sensuality facundity camaraderie and creative passion and represented by goddesses such as inana Ishtar Asher and Aphrodite fundamentally the venusian AR archetype is one of symbiosis through which the many become one and are increased by one Venus is associated with copper which for at least 10,000 years has been used in the creation of jewelry and thus associated with beauty and femininity copper also becomes green when oxidized mirroring the transformation of soil into plant life which is generated through the incorporation of the soil into the harmonious order of the plant's living bodies Venus is harmonization and synthesis but also their objective the beauty which is achieved through such coalescence the planet Mars is one of fire weapons libidinal passion striving and achievement most fundamentally the Martian archetype is the principle of action and therefore of transfiguration it is through Martian striving that possibilities come to be realized and through which the world comes to be transformed whereas Venus signifies the feminine mode of libidinal Mars represents the masculine mode of liid anality Mars is regarded as the ruler of war and violence but also the power to achieve and to overcome Mars is associated with iron a substance commonly used in the creation of tools and weapons and appropriately enough the physical body of Mars is itself tented red due to the abundance of iron oxide on the planet's surface Jupiter is the archetype of growth expansion accumulation abundance and success Jovian deities such as Zeus perkunas and Marduk are gods associated with the sky mountains lightning and rulership the archetypal Sky fathers and kings of the Gods within ancient societies this archetype of growth was considered to be of central significance as this archetypal modality was seen to bring forth the abundance and prosperity needed to endure against an often chaotic and hostile World ancient Kings therefore were expected to be those who most fully embodied the Jovian Spirit Jupiter is associated with the substance tin which together with venusian copper comes to form bronze thus signifying the manner by which the powers of the archetypal king and queen can join so as to give birth to human civilization the Jovian Spirit expands so as to Encompass produce and Conquer while the venusian spirit synthesizes that which which is thereby subsumed into a unified harmonious order finally we have Saturn the archetype of the past conservatism time institutional power tradition gravity rigidity contraction and restraint Saturn is fundamentally the archetype of ontological inertia through which the past comes to perpetuate itself into the future and to impose itself upon the future thereby constraining Freedom within the present Saturn creates and maintains boundaries and norms and is associated with the continuity of karmic inheritance saturnian gravity is the concreteness of the imminent world the gravity which pulls down to earth Mercurial ideation or the aspirations of the venusian mar I or jovian impulses before moving on to look at the zodiacal archetypes or the outer planets I want us to First Look at the relationship between astrology and modern science as previously stated I think that regarding astrology as a science or judging astrology by the standards applied to scientific theories is a category mistake and I will be elaborating further upon this distinction as we move forward generally speaking modern scientific culture has been almost entirely dismissive of astrology with a few notable Ecentric exceptions very little research has been conducted at all especially when compared to other conceptual schemes such as the big five or Myers Briggs personality typologies nonetheless some scientific researchers have attempted to study astrological correlations through scientific methods and we will now look at some of the implications of such research in his 1955 the influences of the Stars French psychologist Michael gawan published research which looked at potential correlations between the processions of the planet Mars and professional athletes gin looked at the natal placements of Mars for 570 professional athletes and compared these results to a control group so as to determine if there was a notable correlation between professional athleticism and the placement of the planet Mars at time of birth gowland's results can be seen here and purport to demonstrate a pronounced correlation between professional athleticism and the placement of Mars near either the ascendant or midheaven of the subject's natal charts needless to say these findings were immediately met with immense controversy shortly following his initial publication gawkin invited the Belgian committee for the critical analysis of Paras Sciences an organization explicitly dedicated to skepticism towards paranormal phenomena to partake in a replication study as would become clear much later the study did in fact successfully replicate gaelin's findings however the committee withheld these findings for 8 years claiming that unspecified demographic errors had invalidated the findings in 1976 Professor Marvin zelan chairman of the Department of biostatistics at Harvard University proposed a new series of experiments that would look at a much larger sample size in order to rule out the possibility that the so-called Mars effect was due to statistical or demographic anomalies or if the effect could be found among groups of people who were not professional athletes the study was conducted by gawkin himself and Professor zelen along with Paul kurts chairman of the American Committee for the scientific investigation of the Paranormal another explicitly anti-p paranormal organization the results of this test despite the expectations of zelan and kurts once again positively confirmed that gaelin's Mars effect was in fact statistically significant and inexplicable in terms of demographic or statistical errors the researchers ultimately concluded quote gawan adequately allowed for demographic and astronomical factors and predicting the expected distribution of Mars sectors for birth times in the general population end quote and therefore that the concerns which justify the 8year withholding of the original replication study were in fact groundless in a similar series of studies conducted throughout the 1980s and 1990s the astrologers Judith a hill and Jacqueline Thompson investigated the purported correlation between the occurrence of naturally red hair and the placement of the planet Mars within natal charts we are all probably familiar with the rather sarcastic stereotype of the fiery red head but Hilt and Thompson noticed that within medical literature there was a noted correlation between red hair and hyperactive traits such as excitability or aggression the researchers noted that in several ancient astrological sources these characteristics are associated with the characteristics of the planet Mars and thus speculated that there may be a correlation between red hair and the placement of Mars near the natal ascendant a placement which is said to correlate with outward physical appearance Hill and Thompson's original study looked at a sample size of 500 individuals with red hair along with control groups and found that 27.2% of the subjects were born with Mars within 30° of their ascendant this distribution was Far higher than those found in control groups with a P value of 0000001 a less than one in a million likelihood of occurring due to random chance Mars was also found to have a much lower likelihood of being found within 30° of the descendant of the subjects 99.8% compared to 14 to 18.5% for the control groups a correlation with a likelihood of 1 in 350,000 critics suggested that these factors have been due to a so-called Mars Dawn effect a statistical artifact which arises from the slight statistical preference for individuals to be born near Dawn and the slight astronomical tendency for Mars to be situated near the Sun in the sky in response to these criticisms Hill and Thompson submitted their data to neuros psychologist Dr Beverly stord of the British psychological Society for independent review this analysis demonstrated that the Mars Dawn correlation contributed as little as 1% to their findings therefore validating the legitimacy of their data numerous replication attempts Were Made of This study and when considered together the total P value achieved was 0.7 a statistically significant value despite being less pronounced than that found within the original study though it is likely that smaller sample sizes in replication studies contributed to diminishing the statistical values of their results This research is particularly interesting because of its potential implications for the causality involved in astrological correlations red hair is believed to be a result of a mutation within a DNA sequence known as the melanocortin one receptor or mc1r a genetic alteration which results in different proteins being used within cells within hair follicles as such it seems extremely unlikely that the natal placement of the planet Mars near one's natal ascendant could be causing the appearance of red hair in any mechanistic way instead we should understand these correlations as being a matter of synchronization rather than of efficient or material causality clocks tend to be synchronized with the movements of the Sun but of course it is not the case that clocks cause the sun to move nor is it the case that the Sun's gravity moves the hands of the clock clocks synchronize with the sun's processions because clocks are part of a living breathing world of terrestrial human life in which the correlation between the clock's internal mechanisms and the sun serves certain purposes analogously we should understand that the planet Mars does not cause certain genetic mutations to occur but rather it could be that these correlations are due to the fact that our world is wound up as it were in ways that facilitate such synchronicities within the framework of modern scientific rationalism we tend to only regard efficient or material causation as truly causal a cause of an event must be a prior event which determines the formation of a subsequent event dominoes knocking one another over for example or a cause can be the physical substrate which an event adheres Within the rubber which a ball is made of causes it to bounce for example however as the clock analogy illustrates this is actually a very truncated view of cation and one which only came to prominence very recently in the historical development of human thought Aristotle for example distinguished between four kinds of teoy or causes efficient causality and material causality but also for formal causality and final causality final causality can be understood as a kind of purposiveness though we should be careful not to overly anthropomorphize this notion a purpose can be understood as a formative principle which is it work in shaping nature human or otherwise and such formative principles are able to coordinate events even without direct physical determinations the purposiveness or final Telos gives shape to the form of the unfolding event the formal Telos numerous times throughout history for example scientists have made the exact same discoveries at near the exact same time without any direct correspondences between them these discoveries did not synchronize because of a physical interaction between the two events but rather because of a common Zeitgeist a shared formative structure which gave shape to both instances of the discovery I've brought our attention to the scientific studies above to illustrate that at least for certain kinds of correlations astrological phenomena can in fact be confirmed and studied through scientific means nonetheless I should again emphasize that astrology itself is not a science and here I want to elaborate on the significance and implications of this distinction the methodologies of modern science tend to focus heavily upon the isolation of certain variables such that the exact workings of isolated processes can be examined independently of other processes which might be at play modern science is extremely technological in nature and within the context of technological practices and aspirations such methodology is entirely sensible Machine Technologies need to behave in very reliable and precisely predictable ways and therefore for the isolation of variables allow science to identify and scrutinize the ways in which certain factors in nature determine other factors once such determinations are identified they can then be pieced together in purpose of ways so as to allow for the development and implementation of technological systems the world itself however is not comprised of isolated deterministic variables the process IES which make up our reality are fundamentally and inextricably relational in nature meaning that the practice of using such methods of isolation is necessarily a process of abstracting certain processes from the networks of relationships within which they are found in the real world scientific methodology is in a sense a play of imagination we are asking what it would be like if such factors could be thoroughly amputated from one another and then attempting to realize this play of imagination through experimental or statistical methods within certain contexts such abstraction can play a very important role in revealing the inner workings of the world to us but within other context such abstraction actually obfuscates the reality of the world due to the inability of such methodologies to account for complex living and breathing in inter relationships the field of astrology is a prime example of just such a context and this is somewhat ironically also why pop astrology is such an egregiously poor representation of astrology as a discipline within astrology the placement of the Sun in the zodiacal domain of Taurus for example is associated with a very complex tapestry of possible meanings but the actual shape taken by these meanings within a given natal chart is contingent upon all of the other aspects of the natal chart and relative Transit charts what the sun Taurus aspect signifies in my chart might be very different from what it signifies in yours and understanding the significations of such a placement within a given context requires us to look at the entire array of related aspects which give shape to that archetypal personality complex astrological charts are much like the world itself like metamorphic string figures dynamically interwoven systems which only hang together through their intrinsic relationalities if one attempts to take a single chord of the string figure and cut it away from the figure as a whole then the figure breaks apart and we lose sight of the actual role being played by that particular chord within the formation which it was woven within similarly although we might be able to demonstrate that certain astrological correlations do in fact occur through using scientific methodologies it is nonetheless the case that such methodologies are largely inapplicable to the actual study of astrology itself performing studies such as those conducted by gawan Thompson and Hill may serve important illustrative and demonstrative purposes but believing that there is a correlation between red hair and Mars Rising is not the same as actually believing in astrology actually believing that our world is pervaded by such Dynamic relational and semiotic synchronicities believing in astrology is much less like believing in a scientific hypothesis and more like believing in a certain Narrative of history or believing in a certain form of religious practice we we don't actually evaluate such beliefs epistemologically on the basis of experimental evidence but rather on the basis of how well the ideas reveal to us the reality of how the world hangs together as a whole this is not to say that such beliefs are entirely subjective I very much do believe that there is an inter subjective reality which can be revealed more or less effectively by astrological historical and religious narrative nves but rather that we must evaluate such narratives in a holistic rather than reductionistic way moving forward we will next be looking at the zodiacal archetypes but in order to understand the Zodiac we must first look at the elemental archetypes the Western astrological zodiac makes use of four of the five fundamental elements earth water air and fire it is very common within modern rationalistic thinking to regard such Elemental thinking as having been superseded by Modern Chemistry understanding the world in terms of distinct Atomic species such as hydrogen and carbon explains the world better so we are often told than the allegedly outmoded alchemical understanding of nature what we must understand here however is that atomistic and alchemical modes of thought are in fact two completely different orientations towards nature both modes seek to understand the most basic compositional features of the world atomistic thinking is fundamentally reductionistic and materialistic thinking and therefore within atomistic thinking the most basic units which make up the world are understood to be the smallest units which the world can be broken up into even though of course modern physics has shown us that even atoms are themselves divisible into even even more basic constituents which can hardly be regarded as material at all within alchemical thought however the most basic constituents of the world are understood to be the most fundamental modes of becoming which things in the world can assume alchemical thought is fundamentally platonic thought and as such the forms which give shape to things in the world are regarded as more fundamental than the substrates which things adhere within we can see in the Statue of David for example that the David of the statue can be regarded as more fundamental than its marbl as the statue would share its fundamental Essence with another statue of David made from bronze but not with a pile of rubble made from Marble likewise we can see in living creatures that form is more primary than substrate as herac shows us the world itself and living bodies in particular are in a constant flux our bodies are constantly relinquishing their material substrate through excretion exhalation and the shedding of skin while taking in new matter through consumption of food and water you are not the aggregation of atoms which make you up because even from moment to moment you are not the same aggreg of atoms yet we experience ourselves to persist over time and indeed we do because it is our form which persists even as our material substrate is an Ever Changing circulatory flux premodern people saw forms not particles as the most basic compositional features of the world and among the most basic forms were the alchemical elements water therefore was not understood as a species of molecule but rather as a way of being much like the Chinese conception of Da water could be seen as giving form to the ocean but water could also be seen within blood or lava or within processes which take things into themselves in order to blend and balance or processes which readily change their shape in relation to their circumstances fire ref refer not only to campfires and combustion but also to Passion conflict and War and what follows we'll be looking at the zodiacal archetypes as the elemental permutations of their planetary rulers astrologers also often categorize zodiacal archetypes in terms of gender or the triatic scheme of cardinality mutability and fixity but here I will be bracketing those aspects for the sake of Simplicity as I I believe that focusing upon planetary and Elemental features is the most direct way in which we can understand the organization of the zodiac and the Essences of the zodiacal archetypes therein the planetary rulerships of the zodiac begin with Leo and Cancer which are ruled by the Sun and Moon respectively the sun is attributed to the period of Leo because this is the period of greatest heat shortly following the summer solstice the next sign Cancer is then ruled by the moon which is seen to mediate between the Sun and the terrestrial realm the Moon and Sun are often regarded as siblings spouses or polar complements of one another and thus it was understood as appropriate that their zodiacal domiciles should be adjacent to one another the planet Mercury only ever appears one zodiacal sign away from the sun in either direction in the sky and Mercury was therefore attributed to the signs Virgo and Gemini Venus similarly is only ever found no more than two signs away from the Sun and therefore Venus was attributed to Libra and Taurus Mars the next furthest planet was then attributed to Aries and Scorpio Jupiter to Pisces and Sagittarius and finally Saturn the most distant of the classical planets was attributed to Capricorn and Aquarius the seasonal periods of greatest frigidity the elemental archetypes are then attributed to these signs in a repeating cycle beginning with Leo of fire earth air and water so beginning with Leo we can understand this archetype as being the fire aspect of the solar archetype the sun signifies highest values and by extension also signifies the destiny of individual persons fire is the element which is most closely associated with the IDE rational realm the celestial bodies are seen to produce light and within the terrestrial realm so does fire fire was therefore understood to be the element of the celestial realm itself and the highest domain of the heavens was sometimes referred to as the empirian a world of divine fire and Light Within individual human personalities therefore Leo was understood to govern the highest forms ideals or values which shape the human personality Leo often signifies a powerful inner will not simply to overcome produce or create but to achieve greatness to shine forth or stand out amongst others to answer the call to Adventure to become what one feels one could be Leo is heroic and charismatic yet often egotistical self-centered or unattuned to the reality ities of particular circumstances due to a fixation upon the ideal in contrast to the real cancer ruled by the moon and water is the receptive endergonic coraly of Leo's expansive exergonic Charisma cancer takes ideas or emotional energies into itself and cultivates them rather than projecting outward whereas Leo is much more oriented towards individual ual ISM cancer is more oriented towards the familial and interpersonal just as droplets of water lose their identity as they return to the ocean and flow through the metabolic cycles of Life cancer attunes itself towards the flows which connect things to one another whether emotional processes practices beliefs or ideas like the moon cancer is more nocturnal in nature than Leo the day is the time of activity and action whereas night is the time of sleep dreaming rumination reflection and the restoration of that which has been exerted during the dial periods next we'll be looking at the two Mercurial domains Virgo and Gemini which represent respectively the Earth and air modalities of the Mercurial archetype Mercury as we have seen governs ideational or noetic cont ious the realm of communication thought writing and ideas Virgo is the earth modality Earth is the element of solidity definiteness and the concretion of the possible into the actual Virgo is thus oriented towards the decisions which are made which collapse diffuse ideational potentialities into concrete actualities Virgo's disposition is very selective editorial and even obsessive Virgo wants to get things right and focuses upon ensuring that the results of its activity are highly refined and precise Gemini conversely is of the element air air in contrast with Earth is nebulous permeable and diffuse Gemini is thus more oriented to possibilities themselves than their implementation Gemini is much more readily able to see ideas and situations from a plurality of different angles as Gemini is much more oriented towards how things appear at an ideational rather than concrete level Virgo says that something must be either this or that it must be correct while Gemini says why not both Gemini is thus much more able to reorient itself in relation to distinct situations or in relation to different frames of reference Gemini is naturally able to perceive the multivalency and indeterminacy of the world though it can also manifest as a kind of indecisiveness or an aversion to making strong commitments next we have the venusian domiciles Libra and Taurus which represent the air and Earth modalities of Venus respectively Venus is the planet of symbiosis and Confluence the synthesis of disperate entities into harmonious totalities Taurus the Earth modality of Venus is much like Virgo oriented towards the concrete and actual whereas Mercurial Virgo is oriented towards idilic Perfection and rightness the venusian Taurus is more oriented towards the productive nature of creative synthesis the products or results of bringing the many together into Oneness Taurus thus tends to be Associated heavily with artistic creativity in particular Taurus exemplifies determination and perseverance as Taurus is much less easily distracted or dissuaded by idealic perfectionism as is often the case with Virgo or by indecisive preoccupation with possibility itself as is often the case with Gemini whereas the Earth modality of t us is oriented towards persistence in getting things done Libra the air aspect of Venus is much more oriented towards ideals of aesthetic Unity or moral Harmony much like Virgo Libra tends to be almost obsessively oriented towards ideals but whereas Virgo is more oriented towards a more pragmatic sense of efficiency parsimony or refinement Libra tends to towards a sense of harmonious balance of moral or aesthetic considerations Libra tends to be greatly perturbed by things which seem unjust or unfair and tends towards ideals within which disperate elements are able to freely coexist within an effortless ecological Unity as opposed to a concrete rigid order of established rules as we will see later on when we look to cap Capricorn next we have the Martian domiciles Scorpio and Aries which represent the water and fire modalities of the Martian principles of action conflict and transformation Aries is the fire modality of Mars fire is as we have seen associated with the highest strata of the celestial realm the light producing pure ideals which reveal the world and which guide the trans formations of the world fire is therefore in a sense the element which is furthest removed from the terrestrial realm and thus has the most power to transform the terrestrial Realm irrespectively of the world's Earthly determinate actualities Fire Burns through and consumes that which stands in its way as opposed to Water and Air which Bend and transform themselves in relation to whatever rigid actualities they might encounter Aries therefore orients itself towards transforming the world rather than itself Aries seeks out external problems to solve challenges to overcome and opponents to defeat fire consumes raw materials which then fuel its transformative powers and likewise Aries seeks out resources or opportunities which it can exploit or spend in order to achieve its goals Scorpio conversely is the water modality of the Martian archetype much as we saw with the relationship between Cancer and Leo Scorpio is much more internally oriented than Aries water absorbs into itself or is absorbed by living things in order to vitalize or purify like Aries Scorpio's Martian disposition is oriented to towards conflict action and transformation but Scorpio is much more nocturnal than Aries oriented more towards the emotional visceral world of internal vital forces rather than the external World of Concrete obstacles and challenges much like Libra Scorpio tends to be oriented towards interpersonal or intrapersonal Harmony or the lack thereof but whereas Libra tends to focus upon aesthetic or moral ideals as a means of resolving disharmony Scorpio tends towards internal transformations of self or other as a means of resolving such imbalances next we have the Jovian domiciles Sagittarius and Pisces which represent the fire and water modalities of Jupiter Jupiter is the planet of expansion growth Prosperity abundance and Ascension for Sagittarius this archetype takes the shape of the fire element Sagittarius tends towards the ideal the mythical and the heroic in a manner that tends to be irrespective of or even detached from the terrestrial realm of concrete actualities much like Gemini Sagittarius is oriented towards possibilities in themselves but whereas Gemini tends more towards the multivalent indetermined perent or nebulous nature of such possibilities Sagittarius inflected by its Jovian vitalism tends more towards the role of possibilities as mythical ideals Sagittarius is immensely imaginative aspirational and creative the Sagittarius also tends towards being ungrounded and uncompromising Pisces on the other hand directs this Jovian disposition inward in into the world of the emotional and vital forces Pisces is therefore a sign which is highly oriented towards the inward experience of growth expansion Liberation and joy often times to the detriment of more practical considerations Pisces wants to feel effortless exuberance or ecstasy and as a water sign Pisces is much more oriented towards transforming in relation to external circumstances as a way to maintain that inner Vitality rather than actively attempting to reshape external circumstances Pisces can thus be understood as embodying absolutely everything that Virgo finds utterly insufferable a kind of flippant Carefree attitude which is much more intent upon going with the flow rather than getting things done Pisces does however tend towards being highly agreeable Pleasant and optimistic and thus tends towards counter balancing the pragmatic or stoic severity we see in signs like Taurus Virgo or Scorpio while Sagittarius aspires towards the mythical ideal or Fantastical Pisces is much more oriented towards the imminent here and now and towards facilitating and perpetuating its Jovian vitality and optimism rather than fixating upon the idilic lastly we have the saturnian domiciles Capricorn and Aquarius Saturn is the planet of inertia the manner in which the past comes to impose itself upon the present often times constraining the freedom of the present in a kind of gravitational way but also facilitating the stability and certainty which are needed in order for life to thrive for Capricorn this is expressed through the element Earth the archetype of solid determinate actuality Capricorn is th oriented towards concrete facts and the demands which are made of us by those actualities Capricorn thus tends towards discipline and rules and tends to see its own prosperity and survival in relation to the solid saturnian institutional structures which serve as the skeletal Frameworks of human life worlds such institutional hierarchies are much like mountains and Capricorn is is often associated with mountain goats or ibexes animals which Orient themselves towards navigating such mountainous terrains whereas Sagittarius is oriented towards the ideal and the Fantastical Capricorn tends to towards a kind of pragmatic and often stoic realism Capricorn tends towards achievement and Ascension but this Ascension tends to be understood as a primarily pragmatic Endeavor rather than the actualization of heroic ideals finally then we have Aquarius the air modality of Saturn the word Aquarius implies the Confluence of both water and air and thus can be associated with fog or Mist while Capricorn an earth sign pertains to the inertia of solid determinate actualities Aquarius pertains to the continuity of spiritual forces ideas or emotional Tendencies forms which we inherit from the mental realm rather than the strictly physical mist and fog are in a sense much akin to ghosts or Phantoms and such imagery is very useful for understanding the Aquarian archetype Phantoms are the presencing of the spiritual mental or emotional formations of the past within the present likewise Aquarius is oriented towards the continuity of such inner and often transpersonal forces what jungians would refer to as the collective unconscious Aquarius thus tends to be highly oriented towards intuition highly attuned to that which is present yet ephemeral or invisible to sensory apprehensions such intuition can be immensely insightful and can greatly facilitate creativity or the navigation of forces within Collective cons Consciousness yet such Attunement can also tend towards anxieties and paranoia now that we've made our way through the zodiacal archetypes I would like to add parenthetically that there are in fact scientific studies which demonstrate that the time of year one is born in is statistically correlated with certain psychological traits individuals born in late winter within Capricorn and Aquarius season are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder possibly linked to deficiencies of vitamin D during the late stages of the gestation process individuals born in Spring Aries Taurus and Gemini are more prone to self harm and dyslexia is more common for individuals born in the summer within cancer Leo or Virgo as with other studies I've mentioned these should not be taken to imply that astrology itself is simply a matter of tracking statistical demographic correlations but such evidence does demonstrate that there are in fact patterns to be found within such relationships our world does not consist of random dice rolls or coin flips but rather of complex interrelational formations in which all so-called variables are mutual participants within holistic totalities before we begin looking at history in order to see these zodiacal and planetary archetypes in action we first need to look at the trans saturnian planets those which are not visible to the naked human eye and which thus remained unknown at least physically until very recently in human history the planet Uranus was discovered on March 13th 1781 by William and Caroline hersel this was the first trans Satan planet to be discovered by astronomers and thus the first celestial object which complicated the classical understanding of the heavens which had prevailed for many thousands of years until that point following this discovery the planet Neptune would be discovered on September 23rd 1846 and the planet Pluto would be discovered on February 18th 1930 up to this point the only explanation for astrological synchronicities which I have offered has been the suggestion that simply by the actual practice of astrology human beings have over the course of historical epochs come to develop certain patterns within our Collective psyche which correlate with the astronomical phenomena which were so tightly interwoven with our religious cultural and mythical practices although I do believe that such processes could certainly be at play it is here that we must begin to go beyond such an explanation the trans eternian planets were not visible to premodern peoples and therefore it cannot be the case that Direct obser obervations of their movements resulted in the formation of patterns within the collective unconscious which Accord with those processions moreover such an explanation might lead us to assume that the metaphysical significations of the visible planets were attributed in an arbitrary manner we might assume that if we were to rewind the clock of history and replay the development of human consciousness we might end up with a different astrological system in which the planets are understood to signal ify different things the significations of the trans cateran planets however were attributed in modern times through their empirical study as we shall see as we move onto examples these outer planets do indeed seem to correlate with terrestrial events in meaningful nonarbitrary ways and therefore we need to understand why and how this might be the case in order to do so we need to once again think about these phenomena in an organic manner rather than a reductionistic one the mythologies of mechanistic science tend to emphasize the ideas of contingency or Randomness it is said that our solar system formed from a hot rising and chaotic cloud of gases which eventually came to coales so as to give rise to the orderly more or less stable Celestial system we find ourselves within today it is stated or at least insinuated that our solar system is but one among innumerable others and therefore that it is only by random chance that the features of our solar system actually are what they are it is thus implied that we very well could have found ourselves on a planet which was much like the Earth but in which the planets were all shuffled about into a completely different organizational structure there is no real reason in other other words that our solar system has nine planets it is simply a contingent meaningless fact that the celestial Harmony of the solar system actually is the way that it is and thus no real connection can be found between the patterns we see above us and the facts of human history but there are a very large number of assumptions which underly such a conception of our world Chief among them being that of Mater materialistic reductionism it is assumed that the planets their features and organization and the reality of life on Earth are independent variables such that one could in principle rearrange these variables while leaving the others unchanged it is assumed that it is actually possible that human history could have played out exactly as it has done in a world in which for example there was no planet Neptune or in which Uranus proceeded along a completely different orbit and Revolution period as I have already attempted to illustrate this reductionistic understanding of the world is at best a sometimes useful abstraction but it is not in fact the reality of the world we inhabit our world hangs together as a highly complex and dynamic string figure such that nothing let alone celestial objects are truly isolated variables it may indeed be the case that our solar system emerged from a much less organized much more formless and chaotic Vortex of hot gases but order does not emerge from chaos in arbitrary ways the solar system which actually came to be is a complex interlocking and holistic order and it is ultimately groundless to assume that any of the parts are arranged arbitrarily in relation to one another or to the composition of the organic whole the patterns which came to be realized as our solar system developed the patterns which condition the possibility of complex biological life and civilization on our planet are the same patterns which have dictated the processions of the outer planets it is undoubtedly the case that life processes on Earth hum and nonhuman Accord themselves with the complex patterns of relationships which we see between the Earth Moon and Sun if we understand our solar system as an organic whole rather than as a melstrom of arbitrarily related parts then we can see that life on Earth is necessarily synchronizing itself with the patterns of the whole as it synchronizes itself with the sun and moon even if there are no mechanical causes through through which the processions of the outer planets might dictate processions here on Earth we may very well be indirectly synchronizing ourselves with those outer planets nonetheless by synchronizing ourselves with the elements of the whole which do have direct causal impacts upon the Earth similarly it could be the case that as the collective unconscious of humanity came to be imprinted as I have suggested with the processions of the visible planets the patterns of the invisible planets came to develop within our Collective Consciousness as well because of the manner by which those invisible patterns were implicitly nested within the patterns of the visible planets the order of the visible planets in other words could only have been what it was if the order was part of a larger Unity which contained within it the order of the invisible planets as well the outer planets Uranus Neptune and Pluto were not named by astrologers and yet the symbolic connotations of their names does tend to Accord in many ways with the significations which astrologers have come to attribute to them this might seem to suggest that astrologers were simply looking for the patterns which they wanted to find in order to match the significations with the names but we must also keep in mind that although these planets were not named by astrologers they were named with symbolic relationships in mind Uranus was named after the father of the God Saturn as Uranus is the next furthest planet beyond the orbit of Saturn the planet Neptune was named because of its bluish color as Neptune is a god associated with the ocean Pluto was named on account of its immense distance from the Sun and was thus named after the god of the dark Subterranean underworld as such it isn't terribly surprising that astrologers have found the names of these planets to be more or less appropriate in relation to the symbolic denotations which they have come to empirically infer moreover not all astrologers believe that these names are necessarily the most appropriate Richard tarnis for example although I somewhat disagree with him has argued that the planet Uranus is much more closely related to the mythical figure of Prometheus than the god Uranus likewise although the planet Neptune and the mythical Neptune do share a relationship with the ocean the god Neptune has few other features which are generally associated with the planet Neptune a more symbolically appropriate name in my opinion would have been tethis or even Tiamat moving forward let us now look at what the symbolic features of those outer planets actually are the planet Uranus is associated with rebellion and the dest ruption of established patterns it is correlated with electricity and combustion and with dissident political or cultural movements in many ways Uranus can be understood as a polar corollary of Saturn while Saturn pertains to the inertia and conservation of that which has been established in the past Uranus tends towards the rupture or breakdown of established structures whether cultural political Tech ological or ideological the fundamental Dynamic of Uranus is that of tension and release states of unrest or dissonance necessitate transformation coiled Springs unfurl and release energy as they do so the chemical energy stored and combustible materials is likewise a kind of tension or disequilibrium which can be discharged so as to create fire heat and light electrical currents are likewise fundamentally dynamics of disequilibrium resolving into resting States states of imbalance strive as it were towards transformation and in doing so break down concretize structures so as to achieve novelty the planet Neptune is associated with Oceanic Oneness embryonic gestation fantasies Illusions and hallucinations Neptune is the Garden of Eden Arcadia the archetypal womb and Fantastical escapism fundamentally Neptune is an archetype of unification and Boundary dissolution the pure undifferentiated Oneness from which distinct life forms emerge and which life tends to orient itself towards re achieving this orientation towards idilic Unity can manifest as a spiritual impulse or as an orientation towards escapism through fantasy or even substance abuse finally we have Pluto the archetype of fear anxiety Darkness the occult Primal libidinal and Titanic transpersonal forces of the unconscious Pluto can be understood as the polar counterpart of Neptune while Neptune is an archetype of Oneness and reunification Pluto is an archetype of Separation dissociation and disintegration as well as the fear and Primal will to life which emerge from such separation the existence of an individual organism comes about through the development of boundaries between self and world and thus through the rupturing of the primordial Unity between infant and womb life comes about in other words by visioning apart from other life and the sense of Separation created by this visioning then results in an imperative of self-preservation as the organism must now protect and perpetuate itself in the face of a world which is potentially hostile and chaotic modern astronomers regard Pluto as a dwarf planet rather than a true Planet due to its minuscule size and the fact that Pluto's relatively minor gravitational influence has not cleared the asteroids from its orbital path as such Pluto is categorized with a number of other trans neptunian objects such as sedna orcus and ays questions about the potential archetypal significances of those other trans neptunian bodies are beyond the scope of our present purposes in this video but here I would like to call attention to the fact that Pluto is itself quite unique and in ways that that seem very significant archetypally Pluto is as much a double Planet as it is a dwarf planet Pluto and its Moon Kon are so similar in mass that Kon does not orbit a center of gravity within Pluto itself rather the center of gravity of Pluto and Kon is physically between the two bodies such that the two bodies seem to Tumble around an invisible Center like two weights of a dumbbell with an invisible bar connecting them Pluto represents an archetype of disintegration and separation and although potentially destructive it is through such separation that distinct identities are able to form Pluto and coron are likewise seen to maintain their separate identities without either body exerting enough influence to fully subsume the other into its gravitational order we might even see that Pluto's inability to clear its orbital path of asteroids is itself a similar gesture towards this archetypal significance moreover one of the original names proposed for Pluto was pany and this seems to gesture towards the double nature of the plutonic archetype Kon the guide of the dead into the underworld represents the anxiety and paranoia of plutonic separation while its counterpart can be regarded as the panan veilance the power of such separation to generate new life through the visioning apart of unified identities which mirrors the manner by which the goddess pany is said to bring forth the facundity of the spring as she reemerges from the underworld now that we have a basic understanding of these various archetypes we can now begin to look at historical examples which illustrate their Dynamic interplay and the next few examples will be drawn from the book Cosmos and psyche published in 2006 by the cultural historian philosopher and astrologer Richard tarip one particular complex of astrological synchronicities which is astonishingly compelling is found within the story of Herman Melville and the events surrounding the creation of his Monumental 1851 novel Moby Dick and the correl ations between these events and the patterns of the outer planets Melville himself was born in 1819 during a conjunction of Saturn and Pluto and within a square or 90° relation of Pluto and Uranus 11 days after Melville was born and still within the aforementioned alignments of Saturn Pluto and Uranus the American whaleship Essex was attacked and sank by an 80ft sperm whale according to survivors the whale attacked viciously and repeatedly in a very deliberate and ultimately successful attempt to destroy the ship completely unaware of the sinking of the SX which correlated with his birth Melville in his early 20s would sign on to a three-year wailing Voyage which would take him to the same region of the South Pacific Ocean in which the SX was sunk during this Voyage Melville would meet the son of the sex's first mate who would give Melville a copy of his father's account of the events these events would come to deeply affect Melville and stir within him the beginnings of an obsessive Fascination which would eventually result in the writing of Mobi dick in 1851 Saturn and Pluto would come into conjunction once again for the first time since Melville's birth and the sinking of the SX and during this conjunction Melville would publish Moby Dick incredibly just as Melville was completing his know in August of 1851 and with the Saturn Pluto alignment within only 4° of exactitude the whal ship and Alexander was deliberately attacked and sunk by an enraged sperm whale which had been pursuing within the exact same region of the South Pacific Ocean in which the SX had met its demise even to this day there have been exactly two documented cases of whaling ships being attacked and sunk in this way one with which occurred during the Saturn Pluto conjunction which correlated with Melville's birth and one during the following Saturn Pluto conjunction which correlated with Melville's publication of Mobi dick moreover the sinking of the an Alexander corresponded not only with the Saturn Pluto conjunction of 1850 to 1851 but also with the Uranus Pluto conjunction of 1845 to 1856 meaning that the three planets were aligned in a triple conjunction during this period in order to fully appreciate the significance of these synchronicities we need to look more closely at the significations of Saturn Pluto and Uranus and their relationships to one another Pluto signifies the Primal Abyssal and vital forces which arise from the depths of the unconscious realm forces which we see expressed by the whales themselves as well as within the life and death struggles of The Men Who endured these events Saturn here represents the archetypal super ego Captain Ahab battling to subdue the forces of the Primal Freudian ID which are embodied by the whale The Duality of Saturn and Uranus is likewise seen at play here as the ship's rigid saturnian edifice is broken apart by the Uranian dissonance of repression and Liberation civilized order and Primal chaos yet we also see the forces of saturnian inertia and karmic judgment embodied by the whales themselves tarnis writes quote the Titanic forces of nature embodied in the whale a vivid expression of the plutonic principles of Nature's elemental power mass and Instinct can here be seen as suddenly awakened and erupting in a most unexpected manner as his characterist ISC of the Uranus Pluto complex yet the whale that turned upon and destroyed the seex has also become like both mobid dick and Ahab the saturnian agent of judgment punishment retribution and death precisely reflective of the Saturn Pluto complex as these Titanic astrological synchronicities indicate the story which we find here both within the pages of Melville's novel as well as within the historical events themselves is about much more than whales ships and Whalers rather what we have here is a powerful and symbolically Laden enactment of a deeply rooted conflict of archetypal motifs which can be followed down to the innermost fathoms of our Collective Consciousness one which brings us into contact with some of the most Central dynamics of the narrative that is human civilization the archetypal motifs which come to presence with within the stories of the Essex the an Alexander and Moby Dick can also be found in a much older narrative the Samaran creation myth of the enuma Elish this cosmogonic narrative begins with two primordial gods abzu and Tiamat which are seen as representing the two most fundamental elements within Sumerian cosmology freshwater and salt water the Sumerians regarded freshwater as representing celestal IAL order Purity and masculinity fresh water falls from the sky and is seen to inseminate the Earth so as to bring forth the germination of life from the soil saltwater conversely was associated with blood specifically menstral blood and Associated therefore with femininity and the vital Primal forces of the deep from which life was brought forth abzu the god of celestial freshwater and Tiamat the goddess of Abyssal saltwater are said to have mated and thereby given birth to the subsequent generations of younger deities eventually the younger deities would attempt to usurp abzu by slaying him and therefore stealing the powers of order which would later be used to create human civilization much like the Greek myth of promethus in many ways Tiamat enraged by the slaying of abzu would then give birth to a race of dragons which would then attempt to destroy the world ultimately Marduk a jovian Sky deity and civilization founding culture hero would defeat these draconic monsters and would then slay the great mother Tiamat as well using a fishing net resembling the constellations and representing the powers of order and civilization and a spear representing masculine power both the fishing net and the spear are representatives of technology and within this narrative what we see is the Mythic enactment of a hostile relationship which had come to form between human civilization and the great mother goddess which had by this point come to be seen as a monstrous embodiment of Primal chaotic savagery prior to the development of civilization as we know it human beings lived within nature we had yet to begin constructing walled cities and fortifications which clearly delineated the natural world from the human world yet as sedentary civilization developed we became ever more acclimated to the order which we had created within our safeguarding walls and ever less acclimated to surviving within the natural world itself the great mother once regarded as a nurturing deity of facundity and vitality came to be experienced as a hostile demonic other which Humanity would be required to subdue and defeat in order to survive technology would be among the primary means by which we would struggle against these Primal forces of nature within Mobi dick we see these exact same archetypal Dynamics at play The Great Whale is of course Tiamat the Demonic manifestation of the great mother goddess the primal forces of our own unconscious psyche and the vital visceral forces of nature which human civilization ju deposes itself against how appropriate then that these events and the myth which Melville created in conjunction with them would have occurred during the first half of the 19th century a period in which the birth of Enlightenment rationalism had begun to give way to forces of industrial technological and mechanistic Supremacy and within which the Romantic Movement had begun to mount a fierce resistance to the technological dismemberment of the human Spirit and the industrial unworld of the natural world unlike the much longer Saturn Pluto cycle mentioned above the Jupiter Uranus cycle brings about a conjunction within a much shorter period of approximately 14 years while Uranus tends to be associated with revolutionary breakthroughs of political creative ideological or cultural transformation Jupiter is oriented towards growth towards the expansion of Horizons and the encompassment of whatever is brought into its field of influence the Jupiter Uranus aspect therefore tends towards creative breakthroughs which result in the enlargement of our conceptual Horizons and within Cosmos and psychi tus shows that historically this Dynamic can be seen in patterns of scientific and Phil philosophical breakthroughs in August of 1609 Johannes Kepler published his astronomia Nova in which he introduced his theory of elliptical planetary orbits this development was immensely significant for several reasons firstly it provided a means by which the cernic heliocentric model of the universe could be brought into better accordance with astronomical observations prior to this development the the toic geocentric model actually made better predictions than the capern heliocentric model yet astronomers found the epicycles needed within the toic model to be arbitrary and sought a more elegant Solution by res situating the Sun at the center of the solar system yet this reconceptualization initially failed to actually Accord with astronomical observations until Kepler came to popularize the notion that planetary orbits might be elliptical rather than perfect circles secondly this inclusion of elliptical orbits was immensely significant in metaphysical as well as naturalistic terms the classical understanding of the relationship between the heavens and the Earth maintained that the terrestrial realm was a world of temporality transience and imperfection while the celestial realm was one of Timeless inalterable perfection elliptical orbits were regarded as less ideal and pure than perfectly circular orbits and therefore Kepler's suggestion would have been greatly at odds with the classical understanding of the relationship between the observable world and platonic cosmology the epicycles of the toic model may have seemed messy or arbitrary in certain ways but these epicycles were nonetheless circular thus maintaining the metaphysical perfection of the celestial realm in the wake of Renee de cart's break from classical metaphysics however the sacrifice of such metaphysical perfection in favor of scientific parsimony was now a much more acceptable proposition during this exact same time period in which Kepler posed his model of elliptical heliocentrism another astronomer Galileo Galilee would begin making telescopic observations which would further imperil this classical cosmology during the same summer that Kepler published his astronomy in Nova Galileo would make his first public demonstrations of telescopic observations which revealed the intricate details of the celestial realm Galileo's telescope revealed craters on the moon and the satellites of Jupiter inspiring discoveries but discoveries which did not well Accord with the platonic cosmology of celestial Perfection on March 12th 1610 Galileo published siderius nunus the story messenger in which he gave account to his journey of astronomical observations this time period between April 1609 and June 1610 was one in which Uranus and Jupiter remained within 15° of one another and this conjunction was within 5 degrees of exactitude during the publications of both astronomia Nova and siderius nunus further this period also corresponded to Galileo's natal Uranus opposition a period which tends to Accord with major breakthroughs and the careers of many historical figures the Monumental transition and human understanding which was occurring here was much more than simply a transition from a geocentric to a heliocentric model of the solar system but moreover it was the gradual realization that the same regularities of nature found in the terrestrial realm were also at play in the celestial realm a truly profound and metaphysically Monumental transformation of thought which would soon pave the way for the Newtonian understanding of gravity and all subsequent developments in astronomy and astrophysics in accordance with the archetypal significance of the Jupiter Uranus aspect the scope of natural philosophy had come to expand beyond the bounds of the Earth's atmosphere and into the universe as a whole another Uranus Jupiter conjunction period of immense scientific and philosophical significance took place between November 1899 and December 1900 during November 1899 Sigman Freud would publish his interpretation of Dreams thus initiating a tremendous revolution in our understanding of the human Mind through his introduction of dream interpretation and the notion of the unconscious psyche though Freud often tends to be dismissed or downplayed by modern academic psychologists it is nonetheless the case that Freud initiated an intellectual tradition which all of both psychodynamics and cognitive science are in numerous ways indebted to on August 25th 1900 a day which just happens to be my birthday less 92 years friederick nche would pass away of a stroke in viar Germany an event which is often considered to mark Mar the end of the modernist period of Western philosophy and the beginnings of the postmodern period the nervous breakdown n had suffered 9 years previously which would eventually lead to his untimely death also corresponded to his own natal uronis opposition period during the Autumn of 1900 MOX plank would deliver two presentations at meetings of the German physical Society in Berlin in which he would introduce the hypothesis that electromagnetic radiation is emitted in discrete packets or quanta rather than being indefinitely divisible this seemingly humble hypothesis would Mark the birth of the quantum revolution in theoretical physics and thus come to radically reshape our understanding of the world itself and matter itself over the course of the coming decades two Jupiter Uranus periods later during the 14th month conjunction period of March 1927 to April 1928 the quantum Revolution initiated by plank would come to culminate during the October 1927 solve Congress in Brussels Neil bour verer Heisenberg and their colleagues would bring about the development of quantum mechanics as we now know it during this period two of the most fundamental principles of quantum mechanics Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and B's principle of complimentarity would be formulated and established as Central ax of quantum mechanics during the same Jupiter Uranus conjunction period the Belgian astrophysicist and Catholic priest George lametra introduced the first mathematical formulation of an expanding Universe thus laying the ground workk for what would come to be known as Big Bang or inflationary cosmology it was also during the same period that Alfred North whiten would present his gford lecture series which would later become published as his Monumental work of cosmology and metaphysics process and reality during both of these Jupiter Uranus alignments of the early 20th century we see a similar Motif at play breakthroughs which would begin to shatter the Frameworks of the modernist cosmological models the deistic deterministic and static Clockwork universe of the Enlightenment period was deeply challenged by the inherent indeterminacy which had been revealed within the quantum World likewise the static pre-ordained Perfection of the modernist cosmology was challenged by the dynamism of George lra's inflationary cosmology the modernist conception of the rationalistic atomistic individual human person was cast into doubt by the fian discovery of the unconscious and Whitehead's organismic cosmology would lay the seeds of a complete revaluation of the ontological Assumption of Science in general although the processes set in motion during this time period have I believe yet to fully culminate we can see here again the beginnings of a process of revolutionary expansion which Accords with the significations we see within the Jupiter Uranus Confluence specifically I believe that what we see here are the beginnings of a process which continues even in our present day through which Natural Science as a whole is gradually shedding the vestiges of its mechanistic Origins so as to become a truly organismic and thus animistic form of human spirituality when I first read Cosmos and psyche a few years ago I found tarn's narratives to be quite compelling though part of me nevertheless remained skeptical as I found these astrological threads to be almost too Fantastical yet the analysis of the Jupiter Uranus cycle seem to provide an opportunity to scrutinize whether or not these patterns could be extrapolated into historical periods which were not covered in Cosmos and psyche although I was new to astrology I certainly knew a thing or two about the history of Western philosophy if the Jupiter Uranus cycle tends to Accord with major expansionary transformations of human thought then I could think of no better exemplification of such a pattern than Renee decart a figure who tarnus did not include in his examination of the Jupiter Uranus cycle and one who is almost universally considered to have drawn the dividing line between the classical and modernist periods of Western philosophy so I looked at Renee de cart's natal chart and what I found was almost unbelievably consistent with the implications of these astrological narratives and in numerous ways within decart's natal chart we find a quintuple conjunction including not only Jupiter and Uranus but also Pluto the sun and the South node moreover every single one of the planets within decart's natal chart are located beneath the dividing horizon line within astrology celestial bodies found beneath this horizon line are believed to pertain more to a person's internal personal and subjective World while bodies found above this line tend to relate more to one's interpersonal social or professional life appropriately decart's metaphysical scheme has been called the Great inward turn in the history of Western philosophy his I think therefore I am represented a Monumental reconceptualization of Truth as subjective certainty and of the human self as a subjectivistic perspectival ego very much in accordance with the implications of a chart which is so thoroughly situated beneath this horizontal divide further decart's meditations were written in 1639 during the culmination of his Uranus return period if Renee dekart represented the birth of the modernist period of Western thought then Friedrich nche can be said to represent the final climax of this developmental trajectory of human consciousness n's first work the birth of tragedy analyzes Western culture in terms of two primary archetypes which he refers to as the apollonian and dionysian archetypes the dionysian archetype represents the harsh messy visceral World of Nature unconscious passions violence and ecstasy while the appoloni and archetype signifies ideals of beauty truth and aesthetic Harmony while dionisis here encapsulates the properties of the plutonic archetype Apollo of course represents the solar archetype moreover the birth of tragedy represents the first enactment of a lifelong and agonizing struggle which would play itself out throughout the entirety of n's life the struggle with the archetypal father Nicha was the son of a Lutheran pastor and n's own intellectualism and Atheism were a profound rupture with the inheritance of the past represented by his father as n's intellectual career unfolded Arthur schopenhauer would in many ways come to replace nich's biological father as a kind of role model and personal ideal within the birth of tragedy we see an early form of nich's philosophy in which schopenhauer's influence remained present in a definitively positive manner the birth of tragedy depicts dionysian bodily nature as a hostile chaotic and antagonistic Force which must be redeemed and sublimated through appoloni and catharsis a formulation which still mirrors schopenhauer's own pessimistic philosophy in which nature is seen as a realm of horror and suffering which must be transcended through the power of art music and the intellect yet as n's career continued his relationship with the surrogate father image of schopenhauer would become ever more ambivalent and even overtly hostile as nche once more came to be deeply disillusioned with the super egoic ideal which he had previously revered the archetypes represented by Apollo and dionis would continue to play themselves out in n's later works as n attempted to radically reconfigure his metaphysics so as to disavow his Lutheran father schopenhauer and ultimately his inheritance of the western tradition as a whole looking to n's natal chart we see what is called a t-square Pluto and the sun are directly opposite one another while Saturn The Inheritance and impositions of the past is situated in a 90° relationship to both the Sun and Pluto here we see the fundamental conflict of n's entire life and career represented by the alignment of these celestial bodies Apollo dionis and the super egoic father time now that we've examined some of the ways in which astrological synchronicities can reveal to us patterns which have unfolded over the course of history I want us to next turn to some even larger historical patterns patterns which are even now beginning to reiterate themselves within our present phase of cultural political and ideological metamorphosis just last month as of the recording of this video on January 20th of 2024 the planet Pluto transitioned from the sign of Capricorn into the sign of Aquarius other than a brief return to the sign of Capricorn in October Pluto will be moving through Aquarius for the next couple of decades Pluto's Revolution period is approximately 248 years bringing Pluto into Aquarius every 2 and 1 half centuries which it transitions through over the course of between 11 and 30 years the history of Pluto and Aquarius is a fascinating topic and very recently Chris Brennan of the astrology podcast released a very in-depth video covering ing all of the Pluto Aquarius transits which have occurred throughout recorded human history I would highly recommend checking that link in the description for anyone interested in a deeper dive into that topic in general what we seem to see with the Pluto Aquarius cycle are patterns of profound transformation in human spirituality as well as technology superficially it might seem that spirituality and Technology are diametrically opposed yet beneath that superficial congruity I believe that we actually find a profound complementarity of the magical and ritualistic aspects of human consciousness with the technological and mechanistic aspects of human consciousness in previous videos we have looked at Jean gier's the everpresent origin and his understanding of human consciousness in terms of distinct Consciousness structures which have unfolded over the course of human history these distinct layers of our awareness each represent distinct modes of relating to the world and these layers have been built upon and within one another over time as human consciousness has evolved one Central aspect that the planet Pluto and the zodiacal domain of Aquarius share in common I believe is an affinity with what gibster refers to as the magical structure of human consciousness according to gser the magical structure of human consciousness is one which came about as we began to experience our Consciousness as something distinct from nature itself within the archaic Consciousness structure which precedes the magical structure there is no sense of delineation between the world itself and our awareness of the world or a sense of distinction between the human life world and the natural world Beyond it as we've examined more thoroughly in previous videos the sense of Distinction which brought about the development of the magical structure was facilitated by our capacity for symbolic thought and thus the capacity to cognize formative elements of the world independently of their particular instantiations thus we began to develop an inner world of explicit thoughts which were experienced as distinct from the world itself the sense of Separation then imbued the magical structure of human awareness with several distinctive features which are crucial for understanding the Affinity between it and the archetypes of Pluto and Aquarius our capacity for explicit ideational thought allowed us to begin cognizing forms independently from objects in the world thus allowing us to begin developing an awareness of what things could be were we to artificially alter them rather than what they actually happen to be we could begin to see the stone knives and needles within the rocks for example the origins of magical thinking were one and the same as the origins of technological thinking further our sense of separation from nature also brought with it a sense of anxiety towards nature nature was still seen as the great mother but it was nevertheless seen as something separate from ourselves which was potentially threatening to our existence thus it was through technology that human beings began the project of attempting to subdue and master nature a project which is co- primordial with the birth of magical thinking here we can already begin to see the Affinity between magical awareness and the plutonic archetype as we have already examined Pluto is the archetype of Separation disintegration and dissociation and the Primal instincts of life and death which emerg through such processes as the dissociative rupture of humanity from nature connects the plutonic archetype with magical thinking it therefore also links the plutonic archetype with the archetypal nature of Technology itself within the everpresent origin gibster also tells us that the fundamental mode of magical awareness is that of sympathetic resonance ritualized magical practices are always understood to operate on the basis of sympathetic Affinity things that look the same or which otherwise share in the same underlying formative composition are beli to be able to impact one another in a manner that is independent of space and time likewise the archetype of Aquarius I would argue operates on just such a basis of sympathetic resonance as examined previously Aquarius pertains to the saturnian inertia or inheritance of the psychical processes Within our world in contrast to Capricorn's inertia of the concrete physical or institutional structures of determinant actuality as I have argued in previous videos such mental or noetic inheritance operates through a kind of resonance that operates independently of physical proximity and appropriately the glyph of Aquarius shows us two synchronized waves suggestive of just such relationships of resonance given that such resonant awareness should be most prominent within the magical structure of our Consciousness this indicates a deep Affinity between the archetype of Aquarius and the Magical structure given that the archetype of Pluto is also tightly correlated with the magical structure and with technology it is appropriate that when looking at the Pluto Aquarius cycles of human history we see such profound transformations of both spirituality and technological thinking for our present purpose is we will Begin by looking at the most recent Transit of Pluto through Aquarius which occurred between 1777 and 1798 it was during this period that virtually all of the major cultural political technological and philosophical aspects of modernity came into play all of the features of the modern world which we today understand as truly modern began during this era of the late 18th century as we saw previously William herel and his sister Caroline hersel discovered the planet Uranus in 1781 this was the first trans eternian planet to be discovered and therefore the first planetary body to be identified which did not fit within the traditional cosmological models which had prevailed within Western mythology platonic metaphysics hermeticism and medieval Alchemy for at least 2,000 years archetypally speaking the discovery of Uranus represents our first first encounter with the Abyssal cathic Darkness within the celestial realm our first encounter with the yin within the celestial Yang the year 1781 also saw the publication of Emanuel kant's critique of pure reason perhaps the single most seminal work of philosophy within the modern period within one of my previous videos entitled the metamorphosis of human awareness I also argued that the metaphysical framework developed within the critique of pure reason is also the most complete philosophical expression of the deficient perspectival Consciousness structure K metaphysics I believe represents a kind of ultimate impass a kind of fork in the road of human consciousness as it were from which we can either fall into the black hole that is postmodernist anti-realism or through which we can move forward into the initial phases of an integral Evol evolutionary metaphysical realism in the wake of Kant and still within the light cast by Aquarius through the prism of Pluto the German philosophers who succeeded Kant would begin to develop an understanding of the world which I have argued to be the first philosophical expressions of the as yet still emerging integral structure of human consciousness in the year 1790 the German philosopher Johan VTA published the metamorphosis of plants if you haven't heard me talk about Gerta before then it might seem somewhat strange that I'm putting a book about plant morphology on the same pedestal as con's critique of pure reason but for now suffice it to say that I believe the ideas is developed within gerta's metamorphosis of plants to be the first philosophical expressions of integral consciousness of a mode of human consciousness which will inevitably bring us Beyond both the Conan and postmodern paradigms which have characterized modernity this time period also saw the American revolutionary war which began in 1775 just a few years before Pluto entered Aquarius and ended in 1783 although the American Revolutionary War itself began prior to the entering of Pluto into Aquarius for reasons which will become apparent as we move forward much of the war did occur during this time period and moreover it was after the war itself ended with Pluto then firmly in the sign of Aquarius that most of the governmental institutions of the United States actually came to be established significantly the ratification of the United States Constitution occurred in 1788 in 1789 the French Estates General convened for the first time marking the beginning of the French Revolution in many ways the French Revolution was a kind of mirror image of the American Revolution which preceded it it was a time in which novel ideologies came to violently flash with the traditional institutions of the past in which the Notions of Liberty democracy secularism and Enlightenment rationalism first came to truly manifest as world making and World unmaking forces moreover it was a time in which we see these distinctly modernist ideologies come to mutate into truly horrific truly demonic forms it was also through the French Revolution that the poit iCal divide between the leftwing and rightwing a division which we now take almost entirely for granted came to take shape overlapping with this Transit of Pluto through Aquarius the planet Uranus passed through the zodiacal domain of Gemini between the years 1774 and 1782 Uranus makes its way around our sun and thus through the 12 zodiacal domains much more quickly than does Pluto the revolution period of Uranus is approximately 84 years and as Pluto has gradually made its way through the Zodiac on its long journey back to Aquarius over the course of the past 248 years Uranus has returned to Gemini twice once in the 19th century from 1858 to 1866 and once during the 20th century from 1941 to 1949 on July 7th 2025 about a year and a half from now as a of the recording of this video Uranus will return to Gemini yet again and will remain there until 2033 this will be the first time that Uranus will be in Gemini with Pluto also being in Aquarius since the birth of modernity during the late 18th century but it will be the fourth time that we will have seen Uranus in Gemini since its Discovery during that time period within their book the fourth turning an American prophecy originally published in 1996 the theoretical historians William stuss and Neil how developed a theoretical model of generational cultural and political metamorphosis in which the history of a given culture is divided into phases called seula which are said to span approximately 80 years the book's authors further divide the saula into four turnings generational Seasons as it were which span approximately 20 years as their title suggests the book's authors largely focus upon American history which they see as being encompassed by the three secula which have spanned the past 248 years each of these turnings are said to be characterized by distinctive features the first turning is referred to as a high a period of growth optimism and Novelty which follows a period of immense crisis within the current seculum of United States history this first turning occurred between 1946 and 1964 this was the era of the Space Program the birth of rock and roll music and the birth of consumerist culture as we now know it despite the generally jovial Aura of the first turning the cultural High necessarily fails to address all of the cultures problems these lingering societal issues then give rise to the second turning The Awakening period in which the following generation comes to be animated by Hope for Change idealism and political radicalism within recent United States history this turning corresponds to the years 1964 and 1984 this was the hippie era the era of The Beatles Bob Dylan psychedelic drugs and the Civil Rights Movement as The Awakening continued through the 1970s and early 1980s we also saw the birth of personal computer Technologies The Awakening era was one of progress and Innovation the third turning dubbed the unraveling comes about as the culture inevitably fails to solve some of the core problems which The Awakening period sought to ameliorate the unraveling is characterized by nihilism apathy Decay Hedonism and a degeneration of meanings and traditional Norms in recent United States history this was the period of 1984 to 2008 this era saw the end of Soviet communism which we might be inclined to think of as a positive development but we must also keep in mind that optimism itself often depends on a clear boundary between good and evil with the fall of the Soviet Union one of the most Central features of the post World War II cultural Paradigm came to dissolve this era saw the ascent of rap hardcore punk and heavy metal music genres which are characterized by significantly greater pessimism and themes of rage and violence than we saw within the previous turnings during the fourth turning the culture then comes to enter a period of catastrophic crisis and within the model developed by stos and how we are currently situated in the midst of this crisis period if we look at this pattern pattern of history from an astrological perspective we can see that these historical saula and the turnings nested within them correspond almost perfectly to the processions of the uran cycle the American Revolutionary War was the first crisis of death and rebirth through which the embryonic Colonial culture came to fision apart from its Anglican motherland to become a truly distinct life form in its own right this period of is is corresponds almost perfectly with a period during which Uranus transitioned through the zodiacal domain of Gemini from 1774 to 1782 as we follow the cycle of the Uranus return to Gemini we then come to the period of 1858 to 1866 the period of the American Civil War and the fourth turning of the first seculum of United States history Uranus would then return to Gemini again during the the period of 1941 to 1949 the era of the second world war and the fourth turning of the second seculum of United States history some critics of the fourth turning have argued that it seems rather arbitrary that World War II should be regarded as a Monumental crisis period while World War I should only fall within an unraveling period these critics argue that this distinction seems to be a kind of cherry-picking which serves to force history into the theoretical model developed by the book however if we are looking at history in an astrological and therefore archetypal manner I think we can see that this distinction actually is appropriate these crisis periods are not simply cataclysms they are periods within which the core self identity of the United States has undergone pronounced and Rapid Transformations economic technological and cultural Transformations are significant but what is much more significant here is the manner in which these crisis periods have come to reshape the very idea of what the United States is if you want a more detailed look at the Uranus return cycles of the United States then I have another Link in the description for an astrology podcast episode dedicated to that specific topic according to the theory developed within the fourth turning we are already well within a period of Crisis even now and since the book's publication many have suggested that our present period of Crisis began with the 2008 financial collapse and culminated in the 2020 pandemic this would then suggest that the covid pandemic was our Revolutionary War our civil war Our World War II there may certainly be some truth to the claim that we are already well within a period of Crisis but it seems to me that the covid pandemic was not a catastrophe on the same level as what we have seen within the previous crisis periods and that something much bigger may be looming just Beyond the Horizon after all Uranus will not re-enter Gemini until July of 2025 and it seems immensely significant to me that this Uranus return period will be occurring during the Pluto return to Aquarius the Uranus Gemini cycle seems to be Affiliated most significantly with the generational cycles and self-identity transmutations of the United States in particular much as Saturn returned Cycles seem to correspond to distinct phases of development within an individual human life these Uranus return Cycles seem to correlate with the developmental phases of entire human life worlds the Pluto Aquarius cycle on the other hand seems to correspond to much larger historical processions as we have already seen the last traversal of Pluto through Aquarius seems to correspond to the birth of modernity as we know it moving further back into history we can see that previous Pluto Aquarius phases have likewise tended to correspond to periods of immense spiritual and technological Transformations if we look back to the period of 1532 to 1553 the Pluto Aquarius period which immediately preceded that of the late 18th century we see a massive upsurge of the implementation of the printing press though the printing press itself was invented just prior to this Pluto Aquarius period it was during this Transit that the printing press truly came to be a world changing historical Force this was also the period of the capern revolution in 1543 kernic is published on the Revolutions of the Heavenly spheres thus initiating the transition from geocentric to heliocentric cosmology which we now know as the cernic revolution during March of 2023 Pluto briefly transitioned from Capricorn into Aquarius before retrograding back into Capricorn in June of 2023 during March 2023 just before Pluto entered Aquarius chat GPT 4 was announced to the world as was Microsoft's own AI assistant co-pilot March also saw the release of the fifth version of the AI image generation software mid Journey during March 20th through the 23rd the tech company Nidia hosted a Je pu technology conference which was intended to focus predominantly on the developing Trends within artificial intelligence Technologies on the 29th of that same month 58 prominent scientists Tech leaders and public officials including Elon Musk Andrew Yang and Max tegmark published an open letter titled pause giant AI experiments expressing their concern for the dangers of unregulated artificial intelligence research what this all seems seem to indicate then is that the AI related events which occurred during this period may be a kind of foreshadowing of Trends which we will see playing out in a much more Amplified and elaborate manner over the course of the next few Decades of Pluto and Aquarius at the very least it seems that in some form or another the influence of artificial intelligence will come to be a world transformative force over the course of the next few decades however exciting or terrifying artificial intelligence Technologies may be I do not think that such technological innovations will themselves be the most significant and Central motifs which will come to characterize the phase of History which we are now beginning to enter into much more crucial I believe will be the ways in which this period may prove to be a metamorphosis of human consciousness more generally The History of the United States is Central to this narrative because in many ways the United States has served as the central axis of modernity itself the period we are currently approaching seems to be one in which the United States is approaching the end of its first great cycle as a civilization and simultaneously one in which the human Journey itself maybe transitioning to its next phase of evolution the capern revolution of the mid-6th century was in many ways a foreshadowing of the Conan Revolution which would occur during the next Pluto Aquarius period period in the late 18th century and Kant himself described his philosophical work as a Kind of cernac Revolution within metaphysics the decentralization of the Earth in relation to the sun was an archetypal preface for the con and res situating of the perspectival ego as the center of our metaphysical understanding of the world I've argued in previous videos that the postan and German idealists such as Gerta Hegel and shelling represent the first intellectual expressions of the integral Consciousness which must necessarily emerge from the deficient mode of perspectival Consciousness which is exemplified by Kant however these developments were cultivated by an intellectual Elite the mode of Consciousness represented by their work is one which has largely remained reserved for intellectual Elites over the course of the past 2 and a half centuries this integral Consciousness in other words has remained largely dormant as the seeds planted by Gerta Hegel and shelling have slowly germinated within our Collective Consciousness over the course of the past decade we have seen the accelerating decay of the paradigms which characterize modernity in general and the postor War II seculum in particular scientism mechanistic materialism secularism and neoliberalism are now all rapidly coming apart at the seams and something must ultimately come to replace those ideological Frameworks as I have attempted to illustrate in much more detail in other videos I believe that this emerging mode of human consciousness essentially amounts to what jean gibster referred to as integral Consciousness a mode of Consciousness which will necessarily be much more spiritualistic animistic and holistic in nature than the mechanistic rational ISM and postmodernist nihilism which dominated the 20th century the next phase of our evolution in other words will I suspect be the flowering of the seeds which began to germinate within the German idealist movement one Pluto Aquarius cycle ago astrology itself I believe will likely come to play a significant role in this spiritual Reawakening which already seems to be well underway astrology has remained a somewhat fringed discipline since the rise of materialistic thought over the course of the past Pluto Aquarius Arc yet during that time period astrology itself has undergone immense developments the incorporation of the trans cateran planets the development of comparative scholarship which relates Western astrology to Chinese vdic and even Mesoamerican forms of astrology and the integration of psychodynamic understandings of the human mind human culture and human history one of the most Central motifs of the historical Journey we find ourselves within has been I believe the gradual cultivation and expansion of individual human Freedom particularly over the course of the past 2 and a half centuries it is sometimes argued that astrology is opposed to human Freedom as it implies a kind of inescapable fate which human beings are inextricably bound to this appearance of contradiction is how however in my opinion a rather egregious misunderstanding of the nature of astrology as well as perhaps the nature of Freedom itself astrological Cycles are in many ways akin to the cycles of weather patterns and ocean currents human beings cannot control the tides currents or Winds of the Earth but this lack of control in no way implies a lack of agency on the part of human beings quite the contrary having a better understanding of such patterns in fact facilitates human Freedom as human Freedom requires the responsive accordance to the realities which we are faced with one cannot control the wind but one can adjust one's sails having a better understanding of the Winds therefore allows us to better align our own purposes with those of the natural world a sailor who understands the nature of the wind will be much better equipped to actually get where he is trying to go rather than being tossed about the sea as he attempts to fight against the Natural Forces which he finds himself within astrology is therefore one important element of a much bigger narrative by which the awareness of human beings is coming to expand so as to Encompass the psychical archetypal or noetic forces which we are inextricably interwoven within as this awareness continues to grow our capacity to responsive L contend with and navigate our world will become ever more refined and we will feel much less that we are simply a drift and at the mercy of a senselessly chaotic Tempest of impersonal forces as Carl Yung once said until you make the unconscious conscious it will direct your life and you will call it fate

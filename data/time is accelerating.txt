[Music] [Music] [Music] in one of his numerous and characteristically powerful lectures Alan Watts asks us to imagine what it would be like if we had the power to dream anything that we wished to dream absolutely anything at all further Watts tells us to imagine that we were able to manipulate our experience of time while dreaming such that we were able to experience an entire lifetime within our dream world in only 8 hours of sleeping if you were granted this power what would you do suppose perhaps that first you might wish to live out all of your wildest fantasies within the dream world you could go on whatever Fantastical Adventures you might imagine experience whatever ecstasies of pleasure and joy might seem alluring to you perhaps you would live out many lifetimes within your dreams as powerful rulers with whatever desires you wish at your command but eventually inevitably this would start to become very dull and repetitive pleasure itself seems to demand con contrast without being able to stand out from a background of boredom pain anxiety or exhaustion pleasurable things seem to amalgamate into an indistinguishable homogeneously dull drone living lifetimes of pure ecstasy would become unbearably tiresome as we would come to be anesthetized by their certainty and familiarity so perhaps you would decide to make things more interesting in your dream worlds you would devise obstacles to overcome enemies to defeat opponents to compete with struggles to endure this would certainly serve to keep things interesting and engaging and perhaps you would even begin to add an element of uncertainty so as to keep yourself in engaged perhaps you would begin to Forfeit some of your Godlike Powers over the dream world such that you were no longer guaranteed to be victorious against the struggles which you devised perhaps you would even begin allowing the dream itself some freedom and what sorts of challenges it would face you with the game would become ever more exciting and eventually perhaps you would devise a particularly clever trick in order to amplify things ever further you decide to dream that you're a person who does not know that he is dreaming you choose to allow yourself to forget that the dream world is in fact a dream to allow the dream world to become immensely perhaps even terrifyingly real such that the power of the experiences could be all the more intense such that the wings of one's Soul could come to feel themselves unfurling in an Ever more liberating way not in spite of fear pain uncertainty and anxiety but precisely through fear pain uncertainty and anxiety with each night you would come to challenge yourself ever more trying to see just how far out you might go to see just what extremes of tragedy and Beauty you are capable of living out perhaps instead of living dream lives as great heroes or celebrities or famous Geniuses you would instead decide to live dream life lives which may seem more mundane superficially in an effort to take in the full scope of possible experience to experience the profundity and the power of things which are quiet simple fragile and Powerless eventually were you to continue dreaming such dream lives each night you would eventually inevitably find yourself right where you are now listening to this recording of my voice on some strange technological apparatus called YouTube after all Alan Watts asks us how do you know that's not what you are doing what else would you do after all if you were God and following along with what's n narrative I think that we are doing much more than simply engaging in an interesting thought experiment there is I believe something deeply and cosmically profound which watt's journey of imagination points us towards something deep within the very Beating Heart of our existence within the core of what it is to be anything at all through what narrative we can begin to see this mysterious something however dimly flickering like a point of light upon a distant Misty Horizon but I think that we can bring this distant point of light into better focus in this narrative what exactly is it that compels the dreamer what exactly is the dreamer reaching for which not only NE necessitates but actually demands pain fear uncertainty and forgetting it would seem that within us there is a kind of primordial will but through what's narrative we can see that this fundamental will has a very specific kind of structure it is a will unto experience of course but within that very notion of a will unto experience we can begin to unravel a very intricate metaphysical architecture first we should remember that at the very beginning of our journey we found that Endless Euphoria simply doesn't cut it pure undifferentiated Bliss is essentially indistinguishable from unbearable boredom and I don't think that this is simply a matter of the psychological makeup of the human animal being itself necessarily implies difference it implies contrasts of this and that of Stillness and intensity it implies a togetherness of things which are separated differentiated a total lack of such differentiation is nothingness it is no no thingness as thingness necessarily implies contrasts within indic philosophy brahan is regarded as the ultimate Oneness of pure Consciousness which is said to underly all of reality it is everything and it is nothingness pure feeling pure potentiality Brahman is sometimes described as satand being Consciousness and Bliss pure blissfulness we may thus conclude is the starting point which underlies the possibility of a world coming to emerge from such undifferentiated Oneness if the primordial will of God were the will to Bliss then there would be no need for a world at the beginning of watt's story when we imagined ourselves living dream lives of pure Blissful Euphoria we were imagining ourselves to be regressing back to such a state of undifferentiated Oneness the lack of differentiation resulted in a kind of anesthesia after feeling nothing but pleasure for long enough that such pleasure could only contrast with itself such feelings of pleasure came to be felt as essentially nothing at all we felt the need to mix things up and make them more unpredictable dangerous and exciting because the boredom which we felt was metaphysically speaking The Lure of the Abyssal Oneness from which all things emerged the anesthesia of deep dream less sleep in asking ourselves what sort of will compelled us to give over our control of the dream world we are asking what sort of will could have stirred the Oneness of satand so as to compel it to give birth to an actual World from an endless ocean of pure Blissful potentiality the First Quality which we might notice here is that the will unto being necessarily implies a will to differentiation recall that as we strove to make our dream lives more enjoyable we came to relinquish the Godlike power which we commanded over the dream worlds in so far as we remained in total control of the dream Worlds the dream worlds remained within our own Consciousness there was no real distinction between where our own feelings ended and the dreams began yet our inner will unto experience necessitated that we give up such boundless power and thus necessitated that a separation was allowed to form between the consciousness of the dreamer and the world of the dream itself this relinquishing of power and consequent division of subjectivity allowed for an intensification of experience indeed it would seem that intensity is a very Central feature of this will unto experience which we are attempting to bring into Focus but intensity alone does not seem specific enough to truly capture the driving impulse which is at work here we are just as capable of experienc experiencing intensities of pain and suffering as we are capable of experiencing intensities of ecstasy and joy indeed our will unto experience did demand that we make room for the possibilities of Agony and anxiety but the inclusion of such negative feelings into our dream lives was always serving a purpose to allow for the possibility of truly meaningful powerful experiences to allow for the possibility of the experience of what we might refer to Simply as Beauty but here again the word beauty might seem to fail us in certain ways depending upon how we might conceptualize the notion within traditional platonic metaphysics beauty is understood to be a mirroring of the formal realm within the imminent worldly realm a statue of a human body for example is understood to be beautiful in so far as it approximates the Eternal transcendental form of the human body the transcendental realm is understood to be a world of Timeless Perfection and the imminent corporeal world is understood to be a realm of fleeting temporal imperfection no statue of the human body no matter how perfect can ever truly be the Timeless form of the human body and therefore the beauty of such a statue can only ever be fleeting and approximate yet if the ideal form in question is itself a possibility of experience then this implies that the transcendental form of the will unto experience must itself necessitate an imminent world the trans ental Eternal object that is the will unto experience must itself contain a necessitation of imperfection of pain of uncertainty Agony temporality and impurity therefore if our will unto experience is a will unto Beauty we must understand Beauty in a more nuanced way than the manner implied by the platonic tradition if we understand forms in the manner indicated by Alfred North Whitehead as potentialities which are real in so far as they are able to participate in the structuring OR patterning of the world's ever ongoing self-generation then we can begin to see Beauty in a more nuanced manner beauty is in a sense the approximation of a transcendental form but the form being approximated is itself the possibility of a certain kind of experience namely experience in which differences and separations are unified through harmonization the will to intensity necessitated by the will unto experience comes to generate differentiation separation uncertainty chaos and dissonance simultaneously the will unto Beauty which is also necessitated by the will unto experience drives reality towards the unification or harmonization of such differences the one becomes many and then the many become one and are increased by one that is to say that through such a process of symbiogenesis differences do not simply break down into a homogeneous undifferentiated uniformity as such a motion would simply return us to our starting point of SAT chidananda but rather different entities maintain their separation even as they are unified into more complex totalities which are more than the sum of their parts the many become one and the Oneness which is thereby achieved is something ontological distinct from the parts which comprise that Oneness in his 1917 text the idea of the Holy the German philosopher and theologian Rudolph Otto coined the term numinus in his efforts to conceptualize the nature of spiritual experience Otto tells us that numinosity is an absolutely General and fundamental notion such that the concept cannot simply be captured by defining it through the use of other terms nonetheless Auto's work indicates that the experience of the numinous can be understood as consisting of many distinctive features the numinus can be understood as a kind of awe in which the human sense of self-world delineation comes to be subordinated or rather sublimated into an experience of one the experience of numinosity is not simply a feeling of bliss or pleasure it is in many ways a lional experience one of both Terror and Majesty Agony and Bliss moreover it can be understood as a feeling of redemption a feeling that the pain and sorrow of one's experiences past or present and even the pain and sorrow of other beings comes to to be rectified through their incorporation into a harmonious totality which is unspeakable apophatic in its power and ultimacy Rudolph utto employed the notion of the numinous in an effort to understand The Human Experience of the spiritual but if we understand the numinous in metaphysical terms we can begin to see that the will unto experience which we have been pursuing is itself a will unto numinosity this will unto numinosity is the faint light which began to appear within Alan watt's imaginative narrative that which compels the dreamer towards releasing control and submitting himself to the power and otherness of the dream the will to intensity within the will to experience reveal Wills itself to be a will unto intensity of numinosity we can then begin to see that it is this same will to numinosity which compels the actualization of the world from Pure possibility of a world the form or potentiality for numinosity is that which stirs the formless Oneness of satchidananda so as to animate the processes of cosmogenesis it is the logos which gives shape to the formless Abyssal deep as we become clearer as we move forward such a will to numinosity is I believe the only form which can actually compel the actualization of a world as it is the only transcendental object which necessitates its own actualization ation through the generation of a world there is a kind of inextricable tragic beauty within this will and its implications and yet it indicates a center of cosmogonic gravity as it were a fundamental Guiding Light which drives and gives shape to the unfolding of our reality this Inner Light this eternal logos can be seen as the Beating Heart of all beings an inner light which drives the perpetually ongoing self-generation of the world and the self-generation of the living processes which constitute the world just as the emergence of the world itself can be understood as an act of ultimate self-creation from Pure potentiality likewise each moment of organ is mic experience can be understood as an act of mutualistic self-creation in which beings create themselves in co-participation with one another and with the cosmos as a whole a process which the philosopher Donna harway describes as sasis or cocreation a kind of symbiotic Twist of Francisco Vera's notion of autop Asis or self-creation moments of living experience create themselves and create one another and then such moments of experience come to be incorporated into the past every droplet of actuality comes to be interwoven into the fathomless manifold of the cosmos as a whole within which these droplets can then serve as the found found ational canvas upon which novelty can be perpetually reborn a cosmic memory or Cosmic body which is perpetually reborn through its contribution of itself into novel moments of actualization the very possibility of existing within a world necessitates distinction the separation of differentiated co-inhabitants of a world furthermore this possibility necessitates the togetherness or solidarity of such differences it is only through the primordial will unto being the will unto numinosity that undifferentiated potentiality is able to divide so as to generate such differences and simultaneously stimulate the symbiosis through which such differences are able to be synthesized into novel developments of cosmic evolution in other words this will to numinosity within individual beings is more than simply a self-affirming or selfs serving impulse each moment of becoming which is created through microcosmic particular manifestations of this logos come to serve the logos at a cosmic scale each moment of experience however ecstatic or tortured comes to contribute itself into the syonic architecture of the cosmos every moment of dissonance as with every moment of consonant comes to be constitutive of the ever Dynamic harmonic composition of the world the inner will to numinosity which was gestured towards by Alan watt's imaginative dream journey is in fact the logos which animates reality as a whole the transcendental object which conditions the possibility of time the Omega which is the end of time in the sense that it is the purposiveness of time which endures eternally Beyond time just as a distant point of Light May lure us forward forward guiding us through Darkness this Omega is the power which lures forward the creative advance of reality itself yet this is a light which is found within the innermost core of all beings it is the eternally Beating Heart of world animation yet as we have already seen the intensification demanded by this will to new it also demands separation dissociation and Amnesia the birth of a being into a world implies a dissociation of that being from the world which it is born out of a continuous undifferentiated field of Consciousness comes to Vision apart in the formation of boundaries between self and other in order for differences to be maintained beings must maintain their own boundaries such that they do not simply dissolve back into the world which they are interwoven within the sense of self-world delineation which develops through the generation of particular beings can then come to manifest as a lure towards one of three possible tons or formative attractors the first as we have already seen is the will to numinosity itself in which the individual selfhood is drawn towards reintegrating itself within a world which the self identifies with this Omega thus necessitates that the self be willing to relinquish itself to the cosmos at large and reassociate that which has been dissociated however it is also often the case that the individual self comes to experience the world Beyond it as an external dangerous and even adversarial other the world after all is often very dangerous for individual organisms nature is immensely violent and Savage in as much as it is life bestowing and Sublime individual beings must protect themselves against a world which often times truly is hellbent upon devouring them as this sense of self-world dissociation becomes more acute the inner logos of self-world reintegration can come to be distorted and mutate into one of two possible counter tons the first of these following Rudolph Steiner I will be referring to as the aramic impulse a will to self-securing through the domination subordination and Mastery of the world the self comes to see the world as a threat to its own will to self-securing or self-perpetuation and in response to this the self Wills itself towards the conquest of that which is experienced as an adversarial other within the realm of human life worlds the armonic impulse strives to subdue and subordinate the world through the expansion and solidification of power structures whether those be sociocultural militaristic economic institutional ideological or technological the armonic impulse strives towards growth and expansion at all costs much like a cancer driven by a will to devour which continues to grow and consume even as it destroys the body which its own existence depends upon the armonic impulse is also oriented towards the creation and solidification of hierarchies as the armonic impulse comes to shape human societies it gives rise to pyramidal structures of authority control economic exploitation and coercive domination we can see such hierarchical man manifestations in Social stratifications but we can also see it manifesting quite literally within the physical hierarchical structures of architectural motifs castles citadels Cathedrals spires and Towers perhaps ironically this hierarchical disposition of the armonic impulse compels itself towards the dissolution of individual human selfhood even though the impulse itself often originates from within the human self as the activity of the aonic impulse comes to generate Titanic institutional structures such Titans come to be driven by their own internal armonic imperatives of self securing expansion and domination nation states Empires corporations or religious institutions come to be driven by their own internal will to self-securing which operates independently of and often in conflict with the will to self-securing of the individual human beings who are incorporated into the bodies of such institutional Titans in other words the will to dominate of an Empire for example is ontologically distinct from the will to dominate of the Emperor or the Empire's soldiers or oligarchs transpersonal aonic power structures behave in a very organismic manner the institutions themselves operate through an inner logic of self-preservation and self furthering a will to dominate which is more than simply an aggregation of the wills which manifest within the selves of individual human beings or even collectives of human beings often times we see that such transpersonal aonic systems have come to take advantage of the will to power of individual human beings using individual human ambition and pathos as a means of furthering the ends of the Titans themselves as it were yet over the course of human history as such armonic institutional Titans have become ever larger more complex and more intelligent we see a concerted effort on the part of such institutions towards the annihilation of the human ego such that human bodies and populations of human bodies can more readily be mobilized as the organs of the institutional Power Systems which they are embedded within the evolution of such aramon Titans over the course of history and the relationship between such Titans and the human sense of selfhood are topics which we will be returning to in more detail once we come to look at how these Dynamics have played out in the modern era through the development of Machine Technologies and information Technologies aramon however is but one side of the coin we are currently examining the other side of that coin is an Impulse which I once again following Rudolph Steiner will be referring to as the luciferic impulse the will to self deification much like the armonic impulse the luciferic impulse comes to emerge from a sense of alienation from the world from the sense that the world is an antagonistic other while the armonic impulse responds to this alienation through a will to dominate the luciferic impulse responds to this alienation through a disavowal of the world the luciferic impulse rather than attempting to master and control the world strives instead towards a kind of transcendence through which the individual self can escape the world the luciferic spirit sees the world as a fallen corrupt in impure nefarious and disgusting place Lucifer thus strives towards a deification of the self such that the individual self comes to achieve a kind of false Divinity which abandons the world through a kind of false Transcendence historically we can see the luciferic spirit embodied in aesthetic practices luciferic aestheticism M disavows the world and those enraptured by the luciferic spirit therefore frequently come to disavow their own bodies resulting in practices such as self flagellation or to take a particularly extreme example the practice of soos shinsu the ritualized self-termination through self-mummification which some Japanese Buddhist monks engaged in as a means of achieving spiritual Liberation from samsara in the modern world we can see this luciferic impulse embodied most blatantly by the transhumanist movement much like the aesthetic Priests of Prior epochs transhumanists disavow the human body seeing it as a flawed meat prison which has been created by the Blind and ultimately purposeless algorithms of Darwin and natural selection within the Theology of transhumanism nature itself comes to play the role once played by yal De beo in the LIF denying luciferic forms of gnosticism transhumanists dream of liberating themselves from their corporeal composition through the use of machine and information Technologies they Aspire towards dreams of IM mortality and the possibility of living within tailormade simulations within which they might live out their fantasies in such a way that their will is unencumbered by the blunt realities of an imperfect Fallen World there is of course something deeply ironic about such aspirations the technological aspirations of Lucifer transhumanism almost perfectly mirror the aspiration towards spiritual World Transcendence and self deification which we see in previous eras of human history transhumanism is of course fundamentally atheistic and materialistic as such within transhumanism the luciferic impulse comes to manifest itself as a will to recreate the spiritual in a technological manner while the armonic impulse tends towards the generation of institutional power structures and saturnian hierarchies the luciferic impulse tends to strive towards the liberation of individual human beings from such stratified structures the luciferic impulse is in a sense fundamentally egoic and narcissistic in nature but it can and does often come to manifest in collectivistic transpersonal ways when this occurs the luciferic impulse attempts to annihilate the power structures and institutions created through the activity of the armonic impulse the luciferic wills itself towards the annihilation of the institutions which signify the Fallen nature of the world and thereby towards the recreation of the world in accordance with the luciferic will unto self deification we see this impulse enacted most blatantly in historical events like the French Revolution or in the Marxist will towards the creation of a materialistic utopian fantasy world just as the armonic comes to stratify the world in accordance with structures of coercive domination the luciferic attempts to tear down such hierarchies in an effort to achieve the liberation of the human ego from the world world it is the luciferic impulse which gives rise to what Friedrich nche described as the transvaluation of values the alienated human ego comes to see the world as incurably corrupt and fallen and then comes to see significations of worldly Vitality as indications of moral corruption and evil success wealth Health SE uality bodily pleasure and any other indications of human flourishing within the world come to be seen as evil while sickness poverty weakness and emaciation come to be seen as signifiers of moral virtue the luciferic ego sees the world itself as inherently evil and therefore develops a sense of resentment towards those who seem to have achieved fulfillment or Vitality within such a fallen world yet once again with a kind of bitter irony the luciferic impulse always comes to mutate into its opposite whenever it achieves any degree of success in its project of tearing down and recreating the world in its own image the luciferic world denying asceticism of Roman Christianity came to mutate into the aonic power structures of institutional Christianity as soon as it came to supplant the pre-christian power structures of the late Roman Empire which it pitted itself against the luciferic impulse which drove the French Revolution came to mutate into a reenactment of the Roman Empire's Aram monic Spirit just as the last pillars of French medieval monarchism came to fall fall just as soon as the Russian and Chinese Marxist revolutions tore down the power structures of feudalism and finan or capitalism those revolutions came to recreate the armonic motifs of industrial world domination which characterized financier capitalism the underlying logic of armonic power came to regenerate itself in an even more pathological way only now with bright red flags which more clearly signified the ever lingering Spirit of Roman imperialism as the armonic spirit comes to concretize into systems of institutionalized coercive domination it creates the conditions within which luciferic world disavowal is able to germinate conversely as the luciferic spirit comes to burn down the societ structures which it opposes it creates the conditions through which the armonic spirit is able to regenerate itself in an even more pathological and domineering way as we look at the overall scope of human history we can see a kind of pendulum swing through which the armonic and luciferic impulses come to germinate within one another and ultimately mutate into one another in a kind of cancerous self ulating dance of power and violence this perpetually metamorphic interplay of the armonic and luciferic is indicative of the underlying metaphysical structure which the two impulses are both manifestations of specifically they are both enactments of a sense of self-world alienation in looking more closely at the implied teleology of such impulses we can begin to see why it is only the Omega the will to numinosity which is capable of generating a world from conditions of pure potentiality in order to look more closely at the deeper implications of these teleologies I now want us to look at the intellectual expressions of these impulses which we find in postmodernist forms of metaphysics within postmodernist metaphysics and more specifically with thinkers like Friedrich nche Gia Deo Michelle Fuko and Nick land we see either implicit or explicit indications that the driving logos of the cosmos is itself either the armonic impulse the luciferic impulse or some amalgamation of the two Nicha was the most seminal thinker in in this tradition as he saw the ontological substrate or hypopyon of reality itself as being what he described as a Will To Power and we see this ontology elaborated most thoroughly in the subsequent works of g l n understood the will to power as being fundamentally a will unto life affirmation through which the individual being Wills itself unto the differentiation of itself from the world and then the repetition of itself through incorporation or subordination of the world the Nan will to power and the Delian dynamics of difference and repetition strive towards ever renewed self-generation and through this perspective the entirety of the world beyond the ego perspective comes to be seen seen as a nefarious force of domination which restrains and hinders the will to power form truth morality traditions and even the ontological composition of the human self and human body all come to be seen as adversarial to the innermost driving force of the will to power the will to self-generating self-affirmation there is much more to be said about such nichan and post nichan ontologies than we will be covering in this video but for now I want to bring our attention to what the ultimate teleological aim or attractor of such a will to power must necessarily be within such metaphysics the adversarial relationship between the individual being and the world is rified so as to be understood as a fundamental ontology the armonic and luciferic impulses in other words come to be understood as manifestations of an underlying impulse which is driven by the mutual negating of self and world and this Mutual negation is understood to be the fundamental nature of reality itself such metaphysics of Will To Power in other words is fundamentally a metaphysics of alien between self and world so let us now take an imaginative leap much like that of Alan Watts with which our story began let us imagine what such a nichan or Delian Will To Power would ultimately achieve if its capabilities were completely boundless if the world was unable to push back against the impulses of such a Will To Power if the armonic or luciferic impulses could dream whatever they wish to dream one of the most penetrating examinations of this possibility is articulated I believe in Ursula K leguin's 1971 science fiction novel The lathe of Heaven the story of the lathe of Heaven begins with the protagonist George or a man living in Portland Oregon in the year 2002 who has been abusing drugs as a way to prevent himself from dreaming due to his substance abuse George is required to attend therapy sessions with a psychiatrist Dr William habber during these sessions George explains to Dr habber that he has been attempting to prevent his dreams due to having experienced what he calls effective dreaming when George dreams any changes to the world within the dream become the qualities of the real world when he wakes up George retains his memory of what the world was like prior to this effective dreaming but the world itself is completely altered including the history of the world and no one else remembers what the world was like prior to the effective dreaming at first Haber regards this as some sort of neurotic delusion but eventually comes to believe that George does in fact possess the power of effective dreaming once Haber concludes that George's effective dreams are in fact real he realizes that he might be able to use this capability to intentionally reshape the world into a better place ha convinces George to participate in experiments using a kind of biof feedback technology using a machine machine referred to as an augmentor as a way to control what sorts of Dreams George will have when he sleeps Dr haber's Ambitions are at least ostensibly quite virtuous he aspires to use effective dreaming to solve problems such as overpopulation famine War cancer and inequality yet with each of George's alterations of the world now conditioned by haber's manipulation s of George's dreams the world doesn't really seem to improve much at all each supposed Improvement which habber instantiates through George seems to create an Ever more distorted and dystopian version of reality as the consequences of these improvements begin to steadily break down reality itself moreover with each new iteration of the world Haber himself comes to be ever more affluent and Powerful until he essentially becomes the ruler of the world as this continues George becomes increasingly suspicious of haber's motivations even though habber himself continues to believe that he is on the cusp of creating a perfect Utopia George demands that habber stop trying to alter reality and ultimately habber suggests to George that they undertake one last session with the augmentor so George can dream that he no longer has the power of effective dreaming yet haber's suggestion was misleading as Haber uses the augmentor to cause George to dream that habber now has the power of effective dreaming rather than George Now unhindered by George's resistance to his plans Haber begins to dream and reality itself begins to break down as ha continues his incessant Quest To Dream into being a perfect world differences between human beings break down as Hab attempts to solve the problems of inequality and conflict between human beings the biosphere of the Earth gives way to a uniform lifeless and gray expanse as habber attempts to in death and suffering in these final moments we see the world come to be completely and utterly inframed to borrow a term from Martin haiger haber's will to secure and control comes to recreate the world in the image of haber's own Will To Power George races through this increasingly alien landscape as the very fabric of reality around him begins to break down into an undifferentiated chaos as the world begins to return to its most primordial state of absolute Abyssal no thingness just before the last threads of reality unravel George deactivates the augmentor halting haber's effective dreaming the world then comes to stitch itself back together though now in a drastically altered way eventually George tracks down Dr habber Who he finds catatonic in a mental War having been driven to Madness by his own fian will to refashion the world in accordance with his own power fantasies through looking at Alan watt's Narrative of the dreamer in a metaphysical way we were able to bring into Focus the nature of the will to becoming which conditions the possibility of reality in looking at The Narrative of the lathe of Heaven through such a lens we can bring into Focus the old ultimate attractor of the aramon and luciferic Will To Power as previously indicated such Will To Power begins with a sense of alienation from the world in which the world itself is seen to be an adversarial and pathological other due to this alienation the will to power emerges as the luciferic deification of the self the armonic subordinate of reality to the self or both as the armonic impulse expands its power it comes to reshape reality in accordance with its own will to secure and perpetuate its own power diversity difference unpredictability and Novelty in the world come to be seen as threats to such will to self-securing and therefore the armonic impulse comes to break down the world into uni form predictable and controllable extensions of the wilt power the world effectively comes to be incorporated into the bodily composition of the will to power itself similarly the luciferic impulse attempts to immortalize itself and Achieve absolute Liberation from all pain suffering fear and uncertainty within the lathe of Heaven Dr haber's will to power comes to transform him into a kind of God and the world itself comes to be a bodily extension of such deified Will To Power in the final moments of haber's effective dreaming we see the world brought to the very edge of this trajectory's ultimate and necessary end point a return to the Abyssal void from which all things begin what we see here therefore or is that the ultimate endpoint or telon of the will to power is the transformation of the world into an extension of the will to power if this will were ever able to reach towards its logical conclusion without restraint then the world itself would come to dissolve as the will to power strives towards the annihilation of otherness all difference all otherness would come come to be negated and without such otherness the will to power would come to be completely indistinguishable from the void itself as there would be nothing which the will to power could exist in relation to other than itself the will to power would extinguish itself as the ultimate teleological attractor of such Will To Power is as we can now see the formless Oneness of the abyss the pure emptiness of satand it is here that we can now begin to see more clearly the claim which I made earlier that the logos which I have characterized as a will to numinosity is the only form or transcendental object which is capable of stirring a world into being through the necessitation of its own actualization recall again how thinkers such as Nia and delus regarded the will to power as the ultimate fundamental and underlying ontological impulse which animates the world having examined such Will To Power more carefully we can now see why such an ontology must necessarily be incomplete such Will To Power canot generate the animation of a world from Pure undifferentiated potentiality because the ultimate aim of such Will To Power is precisely such a state of pure undifferentiated potentiality the Abyssal womb of deep dreamless sleep if we begin with such a state of pure Oneness then the will to power cannot generate difference from such Oneness because the will to power is precisely an antagonistic response to such difference such a will cannot generate a world from the abyss because in such an Abyssal State such a Will To Power is already at its ultimate destination it would feel no need to go anywhere as it were the luciferic and armonic impulses of Will To Power fundamentally strive towards the negation of otherness without any otherness to neg gate such a Will To Power cannot Arise at all let alone begin to drive a process of cosmogenesis the will to numinosity on the other hand is precisely a mutualistic affirmation of self through affirmation of other and an affirmation of other through the affirmation of self the self driven by this Cosmic logos voluntarily sacrifices itself in into the manifold of cosmic becoming so as to facilitate the continual renewal of life and the experiencing of possibilities within a harmonious tapestry in which differences are affirmed yet synthesized into a symbiotic totality the most primordial state of reality is an Abyssal luminous Oneness and as many traditions of both Eastern and Western mysticism have shown us we can experience this pure Oneness directly through delving into the deepest fathoms of our own ontological composition yet as we explored in previous videos the seeming nothingness and emptiness of such a primordial state contains within it all possibilities all possible patterns of becoming all forms all potentialities all mathematical and transcendental objects reside within such formlessness within his 1929 magnum opus process and reality Alfred North Whitehead conceptualized God as being comprised of three fundamental aspects the most readily understandable of these is what Whitehead referred to as the consequent nature of God the consequent nature of God is the corporeal actuality of the world itself understood as an ultimate harmonic synthesis of all actualizations every actual moment of experience comes to be incorporated into the consequent nature of God as each moment of actualization comes to perish into the past and is thereby immortalized through its synthesis into the cosmic manifold of the consequent nature the second aspect of God according to Whitehead is the primordial nature of God which can be understood as an infinite and transcendental Consciousness which consists of feelings of pure potentialities or forms themselves if we understand the most primordial State of Consciousness as being formlessness and we likewise understand the world of forms or anacron to reside within such formlessness then we can see the Abyssal state of pure potentiality which ontologically underlies the world as an undifferentiated amalgamation of two fundamental aspects the first of these is what Whitehead refers to as the primordial nature of God the feelings of transcendental possibilities the primordial uncreated light of pure or form the second of these is the formlessness itself the imminent potentiality of divine Darkness within the most primeval state of reality form and formlessness light and darkness Order and Chaos Transcendence and imminence archetypal masculinity and femininity remain undivided the formlessness of the Abyss feels the possibilities of pure form which reside within it the emergence of a cosmos from such a luminous deep requires that one feeling in particular come to ACT through such Oneness the feeling of the transcendental object which is the Omega the logos the form of the will to numinosity within Whitehead's processed metaphysics this ultimate transcendental object is referred to Simply as creativity the will to the generation of novelty through the creation of difference and synthesis of difference into novel instantiations of harmonic Unity The Lure of this transcendental point of light comes to divide the Waters of pure potentiality the Oneness of the Abyss comes to sacrifice itself as it were in order to facilitate the birth of otherness here we can see that the aramic and luciferic impulses are necessarily parasitic upon the Omega such parasitic impulses are most essentially a will to nothingness as such will to nothingness can only emerge within a world which has been created through the activity of a will to become becoming becoming necessarily implies existence within a world and existence alongside otherness and it is only the will to numinosity which is able to generate otherness from the Oneness of selfs sameness the entities which emerge from this division then come to reiterate the primordial Act of self-sacrificial cosmic onic creativity within each being is a striving towards differentiation and self-repetition but this self-creative striving is itself driven towards the contribution of that which is created unto the cosmic Symphony which all entities are creative co-participants within and co- constituents of every particular moment of simp poetic creativity is a re enactment of primordial cosmogony and this isomorphism between the ultimate and the particular gestures us towards what the ultimate trajectory of cosmogenesis itself must be if the ultimate final endpoint or attractor of the will to power is a return to the abyss then what might the ultimate attractor be for the will to numinosity as previously indicated this Cosmic logos is ultimately a will to experience and this Telos can be understood as a will to intensity of harmoniousness it is an intensity of differences which are mutually intensifying through their co-participation within unifying formative compositions this Omega necessitates novelty change and even chaos and it likewise necessitates creative agency and freedom recall again how in Alan watt's narrative the dreamer came to give up his Godlike control over the dream world in order to facilitate the creation of more intensely beautiful experiences the initial division of the Luminous deep can be understood as an act of of self sacrifice but also as an act of absolutely unrestrained creative freedom an act which was self-d determinative in the most ultimate sense that the state of primeval Oneness was driven by nothing other than its own fundamental attributes towards the creation of otherness and thus to the birth of the cosmos to some degree every creative act of every organic process reiterates this initial creative decision distributions of potentiality collapse so as to give rise to determinate actualities and such actualized moments of creative decision perish into the past so as to be incorporated into the cosmic ho yet in contrast to the boundless self-determination of God such creative freedom is significantly more restrained for individual entities living systems are limited by their bodily composition and by their inheritance of the past the creative advance of cosmic Evolution and the evolution of biological life forms is therefore typically a very gradual process in which individual decisions however minute in themselves compound and synergize with one another so as to generate the natural world we see around us if we look at the overall trajectory of cosmic and biological evolution then what we can see is the gradual intensification of creative freedom through processes of differentiation and symbiotic complexification a process which has come to culminate in the emergence of human beings as we have seen in previous videos specific Al in regards to the works of Arthur imy Young and tahar Des shardan human beings come to occupy a unique position of truly Cosmic significance among the other forms of life which constitute our reality the human psyche is not just a more complex or powerful instantiation of the cognitive or neurological processes found among other complex life forms what makes us unique is not simp simply that we have bigger brains or more cognitive horsepower rather the uniqueness of humanity at least in terms of our cognitive capabilities lies in our capacity to cognize forms in themselves independently of particular instantiations of a given form we are able to abstract the form of a circle for example from particular circular objects and thus regard the the form of circularity itself as such human beings are able to impose forms upon corporeal objects shaping objects in the world in accordance with particular forms and thereby creating artifacts such as tools and works of art we would also come to use sounds and markings as a means of signifying forms and thereby develop symbolic language through these capabilities human beings have come to reshape the world in relation to our psychical realm of formal cognitions giving rise to human life worlds corporeal manifestations of the semiotic architecture of our Collective psychical World from a cosmological perspective the significance of the human psyche lies in the manner by which it mirrors the conceptual consciousness of what Whitehead refers to as the primordial nature of God As We examined earlier Whitehead conceptualized this primordial nature as an eternal and boundless Consciousness constituted by feelings of forms or to rephrase this in Whitehead's own terminology the primordial nature consists in pure conceptual prehensions of Eternal objects the role of this primordial nature then lies in evaluating the realm of forms in relation to the fundamental impulse of cosmogonic creativity what I have dubbed the will to numinosity and thereby conditioning the relationship between potentialities or forms and the processes of actualization through which the cosmos continually comes to generate and regenerate itself what we can see in the human psyche therefore is a a particular corporeally instantiated Recreation of the primordial Nature's fundamental properties just as the primordial nature is able to directly experience the anacron or world of forms human consciousness is likewise able to directly experience forms independently of their manifestations within the corporeal or terminal realm much like the self-similarity of a fractal which repeats itself at different scales we can see that the human psyche is a microcosmic reenactment of the most fundamental animating principles we see at a macrocosmic scale the human is indeed made in the image of God and in more ways than one if we consider this isomorphism in relation to our previous analysis of the cosmic Lo logos or will to numinosity we can understand this Recreation of the divine within the human as the activity of a very specific and cosmologically ultimate purposiveness although the conceptual feelings of the primordial nature might be more pure and boundless than anything we mere humans can even begin to clearly imagine it is nonetheless the case that The Human Experience of real ity The Human Experience of animacy is an extreme intensification of the feelings of the primordial nature to be human is to be lost in the world to be thrown into the world as Martin heiger would say the experience of being human is an experience of uncertainty and power freedom and restraint Agony and Bliss sorrow and Beauty such contrast is intensity and it is the striving towards the harmonization of intensity towards the intensification of animacy that has necessitated the birth of the Human by our Cosmos if we then look to the unfolding of the human narrative throughout human history we can begin to see that this same underlying purposiveness is also necessitating the development of individual human freedom and the development of individual human selfhood in my previous video we saw in detail how this process has come to unfold within the historical evolution of human consciousness the underlying teleology of our reality has destined us towards the gradual contraction of cosmic Consciousness into the particular existences of of living organisms following the emergence of the human psyche the human sense of selfhood has likewise come to contract so as to eventually give rise beginning in the 15th century to the atomic perspectival ego self this modern sense of egoic selfhood emerged from earlier more distributed and interpersonal structures of tribal and nationalistic selfhood and through this process the human sense of individual self agency has become ever more acute the self-creating and world creating power of the human self has come to intensify over time and over the past 500 years in particular our sense of ego individuality has come to achieve its most contracted and singular manifestations in parallel with this expansion of creative freedom we also see an expansion of human technological capabilities and a narrowing of the metaphysical Horizons through which human beings are able to experience and understand the world as we explored more thoroughly in my previous video this point of utmost contraction has also brought us to the cusp of an axial turn through which the human sense of selfhood will begin to expand so as to both surpass and integrate the egoic selfhood which has been created over the course of previous epochs what is significant for our present purposes however is the manner by which this trajectory of increasing contraction and differentiation of the individual human ego has resulted in an increasingly acute sense of alienation between the human self and the world which it is situated within within previous stages of human consciousness the human self was more readily able to identify itself as continuous with its natural environment its tribal kinship groups or religious forms of collective identity as the human ego has come to be increasingly welldeveloped the sense of dissociation between self and world has become ever more intense as a result of this increasing dissociation the human ego has become increasingly susceptible to the will to power which as we have seen is characteristic of the aonic will to dominate and the luciferic will to self deification the will to power is fundamentally a will to the negation of otherness within which otherness has come to be experienced as a malefic and antagonistic negation of the self if taken to its ultimate teleological endpoint such a will comes to negate all otherness and thereby negates selfhood as well leaving only the Abyssal nothingness of pure potentiality the armonic impulse comes to create hierarchical power structures which then facilitate the emergence of a luciferic resentment such a luciferic impulse then annihilates the armonic power structures which limit and constrain the individual ego and From the Ashes of such social breakdown the armonic is able to regenerate itself in even more cancerous violent and monstrous forms the dynamic between aramon and Lucifer is thus a kind of pendulum swing which oscillates between the two polar counterparts of the will to nothingness due to the increasing Acuity of self-alienation necessitated by the development of the human ego self this oscillation between the two poles has come to increase in its overall speed and intensity over the course of historical time the armonic phases of historical development are becoming ever more armonic while the luciferic phases are becoming ever more luciferic and moreover the frequency of such phase transitions is itself increasing as we look to the trajectory which passes through the modern Epoch and into the coming future we can see that the low thunderous hum of the armonic and luciferic impulses is coming to in intensify so as to become a deafening piercing scream although at a cosmological scale the ultimate teleological attractor of the armonic and luciferic impulses is the negation of reality at a more terrestrial historic scale these impulses are striving towards the attainment of self Incarnation within our corporeal world as with all AR typal Powers these personalities strive towards participating within our world but unlike other archetypal Powers the armonic and luciferic personalities do not instantiate themselves in the same symbiotic or simp poetic way that we see in most processes of archetypal life animation much like cancer these processes do not attempt to coexist with other forces in a mutualistic way rather they attempt to subsume all other life processes into themselves even if such consumption is ultimately self-annihilating the proximate teleological attractor of aramon is the Transfiguration of the world into the body of aramon and the proximate teleological attractor of Lucifer is the transfigure ation of the world into the body of Lucifer these impulses are in a sense perverse parodies or inversions of the teleological trajectory which is destined by The Cosmic logos within the Mythos of medieval Alchemy it is said that the philosopher stone transforms lead into gold and likewise the cosmic logos strives towards transmuting the world world into the corporeal body of the cosmic logos whereas the logos enacts this purpose through the affirmation of otherness through the integration of living beings and life processes into its own being the armonic and luciferic impulses enact this striving towards corporeal isation through the annihilation of otherness through the dismemberment disintegration ation and digestion of the world although this is a narrative which could easily Encompass all of recorded human history and even prehistory we can begin to understand the overall shape of this narrative by looking at the manner through which these impulses have come to shape the development of History over the course of the modern Epoch for now we can begin our story by looking to the developments which occurred during the Italian Renaissance a time period which is particularly significant as we saw in our previous video as this time period saw the initial development of the perspectival structure of human consciousness the point of greatest contraction within the unfolding of the human it was during the Italian Renaissance that modern banking practices came to develop and to rise to power as significant institutional structures which would come to rise and eventually surpass the powers wielded by nation states and Empires the development of modern banking practices would pave the way for the development of financier capitalism which would fuel the development of colonialism and imperialism which characterized the age of sale through these transformations in economic Dynamics the mertile financier class would rise to power the ideas of liberal democracy and republicanism would be used as an ideological vehicle through which the rising financier class would begin to seize power from the more traditional power structures of absolute monarchy and the feudal aristocracy here again we can see a luciferic impulse towards the annihilation of older social institutions ultimately serving to pave the way for the development of more thoroughly armonic social institutions these developments would eventually facilitate the birth of industrial capitalism just as the metaphysical Paradigm of mechanistic materialism came to facilitate the technologization of scientific naturalism during the 19th and early 20th centuries financier techn capitalism would come to almost entirely Dethrone the old guards of the social and political institutions which persisted as vestiges of the premodern world ultimately Marxism is a force which transforms the natural world into Capital into a standing reserve of commodifiable resources and labor power which can be mobilized extracted manipulated and wielded Carl Mark saw correctly that capitalism is fundamentally vampiric in nature it transforms the living world into a mechanized inanimate system of abstract power relations however Marxist ideology due to its own metaphysical materialism and pathological Tendencies is unable to facilitate an understanding of the more fundamental archetypal Dynamics which have driven the emergence and evolution of capitalism capital is is in a sense undeath Capital value is labor value and capitalism is a process by which institutional structures composed of capital of Undead matter come to incorporate ever more of the Living World by transforming the living world into more Capital we can therefore see that capitalism is a fundamentally AR ammonic process capitalism is a kind of pseudo organism which is driven entirely by the will to transform the world into more of itself this process is also necessarily indefinite capitalism necessitates endless growth the endlessly accelerating consumption of the World by Undead mechanistic systems as the world Paradigm of colonialist imperialism gave way to the world Paradigm of neoliberal globalism following the second world war capitalism underwent a profound metamorphosis transitioning from a modality of nationalistic industrial production and into a modality of Global Information Technology capitalistic culture forms such as film television pop music newspapers and magazines came to erode and replace the premodern culture forms which had conditioned the Dynamics of human life thought and experience prior to the second world war the erosion and decay of religious beliefs spiritual practices social norms and moral Frameworks came to accelerate as culture itself and thus meaning itself came to be commodified and sold back to human beings in an undead form through mechanisms of media production and consumption as the 20th century has given way to the 21st the technologization and capitalization of our world has come to extend ever further with the Advent of electronic networking systems romance sexuality a culturation spirituality socialization and human attention itself are all currents of the human life world which have come to be increasingly incorporated into the mechanistic body of capitalism itself within the currently ongoing phase in the metamorphosis of capitalism perhaps the most significant ongoing development is the capitalization of the human self and human body the philosopher and philosophy YouTuber Hans gorg Mohler of the channel Carefree wandering has described the emergence within modern culture of a phenomenon which he refers to as profilic the development M of a novel structure of human self understanding which we could call the profile self which has risen out of an authenticity based sense of selfhood which characterized earlier phases of the modern Epoch by looking at this transition I think we can bring into Focus the broader scope of the manner by which human beings are coming to be metaphysically disfigured within the current phase of evolution of the capitalist life world or rather the capitalist undeath world the authenticity self developed over several centuries following the emergence of perspectival Consciousness during the 15th century and came to culminate I would argue within certain forms of existentialist philosophy during the 20th century the authenticity self is understood in terms of a unique sense of individuality the self is understood in contrast with social norms expectations Trends or other such forces which are experienced as constraining the freedom of the authentic self and its will to self-expression or self-creation within some philosophical expressions of authenticity selfhood we see an indication of an ontologically substantial innermost Soul or essence of the human being which is regarded as the true self while in other Expressions such as that of Jean Paul sart the human self is conceptualized as a kind of fundamental indeterminacy which is characterized by a freedom which ontologically precedes form or Essence existence precedes essence as s would say in either case the notion of an authenticity towards an innermost core of the human individual comes to play a central role in negotiating the relationship between self and World being oneself is a being true to oneself in such a manner that the self is conceptualized in a discreet individualistic manner with the rise of information Technologies and most crucially social media Technologies the authenticity self has come to give way to the profile self in contrast to the authenticity self the profile self is understood much more in terms of how one is seen by other people the notion of a true selfhood which Lies Beneath one's performative presentations comes to be abandoned and instead the self comes to be understood as being identical with What In yian terms we might call the Persona within this presently developing conception of profile selfhood Ood human beings come to experience their own selfhood as being identical with the constructions which are presented to or performed for other human beings within an ecosystem of profile interactions through this supplanting of the authenticity self by the profile self the human sense of selfhood comes to be entirely mediated by social media Technologies due to the media ating role of social media Technologies the attention which we direct towards our profile constructs and towards how those constructs are perceived by others comes to be commodified and technologized the phenomenological constitution of the human self-experience thus comes to be transfigured into Undead capital in the exact same manner that the living body of the Earth comes to be extracted and incorporated into the life body of the capitalist pseudo organism as a direct extension of the development of the profile self we are beginning to see the emergence of a parallel process by which the human body is coming to be seen as an extension of the profile self a person is largely able to mold and remold their social media profiles at will but the physical human body is of course much more resistant to being molded in this way nevertheless as the profile self increasingly comes to be understood as the only self with no true or authentic self underlying it the body comes to be seen in an adversarial manner the human ego comes to believe it is no more than what it is seen as by other human beings and the discomfort resulting from this belief comes to compel the human being towards attempting to exercise complete and precise control over their own profile self such that they are able to then experience themselves as being what they wish to experience themselves as being the human body thus comes to be seen as the ultimate barrier to such self-construction we do not choose our bodies and therefore the body can come to be experienced as an external other which dictates how we are seen by others in a way that lies outside of the control of the person's will to self-construction this tendency has already begun to give rise to an industry of physiological self remaking within which the human body itself is coming to be commodified and sold back to us as a product of medical Technologies we have already begun to to see indications of just how grotesque the extremes of this trajectory might prove to be but this is a process which has only just begun as medical Technologies come to develop further their capacity to assist the human Persona in its quest to remake the body in accordance with perverse power fantasies we will in all likelyhood see this tendency come to manifest in increasingly morbid and dehum iing ways in the near future if we look at the overall shape of this trajectory we can now see that the developmental phases of colonialism industrial capitalism consumer capitalism and finally information capitalism have been processes through which the armonic spirit has come to create for itself a corporeal pseudo organismic body colonialism and Industrial Ral capitalism came to create the metabolic physiological body of aramon electrical Technologies and media technologies have created the ethological nervous system of aramon and now the development of information Technologies is giving rise to the psychical body of aramon while we now find ourselves within is essentially the digestive system of a Titanic Undead and self metamorphic Labyrinth one which has carefully designed itself so as to alienate human beings from the natural world to alienate human beings from one another and ultimately to recreate human populations human bodies and human Minds as organs of the labyrinth itself human life worlds have been gradually and meticulously digested disintegrated and reincorporated into the Labyrinth as technology allows this process to operate at an Ever more granular scale and in ever more precisely controlled ways the Labyrinth is now beginning to digest individual human minds and bodies the body of aramon is a labyrinth in the sense that it has carefully designed itself so as to confuse and disorient human beings and to separate human beings from one another the Labyrinth is constantly shifting its own structure such that those who have been born within its digestive system are unable to discern its nature unable to comprehend its true scale and its ultimate reason for being ultimately the Labyrinth exists for one reason it is the will to control to dominate and to devour one of the most consistent and fundamental ways in which the Labyrinth operates is by destroying living systems and replacing them with organs of its own mechanical structure one of the most striking and pathological ways in which this tendency has come to manifest is in the breakdown and Recreation of human familial and social interrelations in even the earliest beginnings of the Industrial Revolution the embryonic Labyrinth began to disintegrate human communities and Reit uate human beings within regimented disciplinary structures Urban housing tenements and factories and later in modern cities suburbs shopping malls apartment complexes and Office Buildings the disintegration of family structures shortly followed the breakdown of communal structures and it is here that we can begin to see the most advanced and subtle manner by which the Labyrinth has begun to D digest the human psyche itself one of the most fundamental structures of human existence which we have examined in much more detail previously is the human individuation process it is through this process that the individual human identity comes to be developed and a durable sense of human selfhood comes to form which can then be reintegrated as an effective member of interpersonal social systems such as family and communities the role of family and community in this process cannot be overstated healthy human individuation involves the negotiation of interpersonal relationships between an individual and its mother father siblings peers Rivals and Role Models through the breakdown of familial and communal structures the processes which normally facilitate the individuation of human beings have have come to disintegrate increasingly it is technology which has come to replace the roles which are normally performed by family and Community rather than immediate connection with other human beings within the natural environment children's interaction with the world around them is coming to be increasingly mediated by information Technologies perhaps the most nefarious manifestation of this process has been the process by which living breathing human mothers have been herded into offices clinics and factories and their role within the lives of their children has been replaced by entertainment Technologies the individuation process always necessarily begins with a separation from the mother through such separation the human psychi is forced to encounter the unfamiliar to contend with fears and anxieties and to develop a sense of selfhood which is independent of the mother due to the increasingly technological nature of children's development information Technologies themselves have come to essentially replace the role of the mother for many developing human Minds The Safety and Security which are normally associated with the mother are now provided by video games social media applications tablet screens and other such devices unlik like one's biological mother these screens have an insatiable desire for the child's constant attention a complete inversion of the Natural State of Affairs the child has a source of endless Comfort safety fantasy and stimulation which the child has no reason to individuate from because the screens never have to leave to go to work the screens never become exhausted or bored or sleepy or sick sick if this attachment between the child's mind and information technology is never severed by intervention from parents or circumstances then it is very likely the child will maintain this dependency well into adolescence and even adulthood although there are innumerable pathologies which can and do come to develop from such dependencies what is most significant for our current purposes is the manner in which these dependencies come to arrest the development of the human ego without becoming separated from the technological surrogate mother the child psyche is never forced to achieve a sense of separate individuality and selfefficacy the body comes to develop into adolescence and into adulthood but the Mind remains in a perpetually infantile State nurtured by the simulated womb of the techn logical fantasy world this erosion of the human ego is immensely significant within the context of the narrative which I am attempting to trace out here because this dissolution of the human ego then facilitates the substitution of the human ego self by the technologized and commodified profile self as the armonic spirit continues to grow its labyrinthine body around us the nervous system of aramon is is also coming to serve as the ground from which the luciferic spirit is likewise beginning to create its Corporal body unlike the Titanic mechanistic body of aramon however the bodily manifestation which is coming into being through the activity of the luciferic impulse is fundamentally virtual ephemeral and hallucinogenic in nature whereas the armonic impulse is oriented toward towards the domination and digestion of reality the luciferic impulse is oriented towards the Transcendence of reality through deification of the human self within the context of the labyrinth this impulse has come to manifest through the creation of fantasy worlds within which the human self is able to wield Godlike Powers some of the most rudimentary manifestations of this trajectory can already be seen in our day-to-day lives video games social media platforms artificial intelligence Technologies and virtual reality Technologies are all contributing to the gradual embryonic development of Lucifer's corporeal body this is a body which consists entirely of simulation it is not a physical body per se but rather a kind of psychical and astral body which is composed of images fantasies artificial IAL stimulations avatars and socalled entertainment through being absorbed into this digital pergatory by the false light of the black star that is the luciferic impulse human beings come to be anesthetized such that their bodily existence can more readily be incorporated into the Machinery of Aron's labyrinthine digestive system as the body of aramon comes to further unworld the human life world and thus further alienates human beings from their reality the luciferic Purgatory comes to be seen as an Ever more appealing Escape Route from a fallen imperfect Earth this is but one of numerous ways in which the bodies of Lucifer and aramon have come to form symbiotic mutualistic relationships with one another as both impulses Thrive upon the disintegration of the human mind and body these impulses thus come to synergize with one another despite their adversarial relationship towards all other forms of life from our present standpoint we can already see the seeds of the luciferic developments which will likely come to unfold over the course of coming decades academic science and the modern medical industrial complex have recently begun to take a very serious interest in the potential uses of Consciousness altering substances such as psylocybin MDMA ketamine and diyl tryptamine among many others substances which until very recently were largely considered taboo within academic and clinical cultures such substances tend to operate via facilitating the breakdown of the cognitive processes which are normally solidified and stable within the psyche of human beings such solidified patterns of human cognition tend to repeat themselves on the basis of their own ontological inertia and such self-re repetitive patterns can come to manifest pathologically as addictive behaviors or as other forms of stable yet maladaptive patterns of thought belief emotion and behavior such rigidified psychical patterns also condition the manner by which the human mind filters out thoughts or feelings which the mind has come to regard as irrelevant psychedelic substances tend to function by softening such rigidified patterns and thus act to increase the plasticity of the human psyche psychedelic substances can allow us to vividly experience the world in ways that are normally unavailable To Us by destabilizing the processes which desensitize us to certain aspects of our experience such increased plasticity can also allow the human psyche to more readily recondition itself to disrupt and discontinue patterns which are maladaptive or pathological the plasticity facilitated by such substances however also brings with it an immense potential for abuse and manipulation which is often overlooked by those who proze the potential benefits of such substances rendering a person more psychically plastic can certainly allow a person's psyche to rec concretize in healthier ways but it can also allow the human psyche to be reconfigured in much more nefarious ways as well it is a very real possibility I believe that psychedelic substances could be used in attempts to further disfigure human Minds such that they are more acclimated to their place within the capitalist hell world as the medical industrial organs of aramon come to increasingly employ such substances in efforts to improve the so-called mental health of human beings what we will begin to see I suspect is an increasing tendency by which such substances will be used in conjunction with psychotherapeutic practices to further facilitate the disintegration of the human ego the human ego is potentially quite problematic when seen from the perspective of armonic institutional systems the human ego does not like to be a nameless drone strapped into a cubicle the human ego does not like to be a faceless Stranger in an ocean of faceless strangers the human ego is aggressively resistant to a life which involves little more than mindlessly going through the motions of its role as a cog within impersonal soulless instit tional machineries as such the medical industrial complex has every reason to use such psychical Technologies to further the breakdown of the human ego self and the substitution of the human ego self by the Persona self or profile self psychedelic clinical practices could therefore synergize with broader Tendencies of ego disintegration such that the human psyche comes to be ever more captured by the luciferic fantasy world or virtual womb ever less capable of disentangling itself from the Hall of Mirrors which has been created through the emergence of the profile self and ever more alienated from the non virtual world which the human body remains within increasingly the human psyche will lose its grasp on its own sense of selfhood and the human psyche will increasingly come to experience reality itself as a melstrom of simulated Illusions fantasies and masks beneath which are to be found only more masks add infinitum this is of course a rather apocalyptic vision of our current trajectory and so it is crucial that we understand the broader context within which these developments are coming to pass as we have already noted this amplification and intensification of the luciferic and armonic impulses has been due to the more fundamental trajectory by which the evolution of human consciousness has come to generate the ego selfhood of the human individual as we saw in our last video the development of the human ego self corresponds to the development of the fifth perspectival structure of human consciousness this structure of consciousness is the point of greatest contraction within the development of human selfhood and thus the point of greatest alienation between self and world as we have seen this alienation presents an immense and world-threatening danger with which Humanity must contend but simultaneously we have seen that even as these dangers have Amplified to apocalyptic proportions the seeds of new Futures have already begun to germinate the luciferic and armonic will to nothingness is parasitic upon the world generating power of the will to numinosity and likewise the armonic and luciferic developments of modern civilization are parasitic upon a more fundamental trajectory towards the unfolding of human potentiality within the ontological composition of the human being we see microcosmic reenactment of the archetypal Dynamics which we see at a cosmological scale and through the historical development of human consciousness the human creature is coming to ever more thoroughly mirror the creative freedom self-determination and life affirmation which characterize Cosmic Consciousness the ultimate purposiveness of this process is the transformation of the human being from within by the COS aonic power of the logos such that this logos will to numinosity or Omega comes to be the central animating principle of human life activity we can see this trajectory as sharing in the same fundamental form as the individuation process which we find in the works of Carl Yung and Joseph Campbell individual self-consciousness comes to separate from cosmic Consciousness and through this journey of Separation the individual Consciousness which is thereby created comes to recreate within itself the properties of the Supra Consciousness which the individual initially separated from following this process of self-generation the human self then comes to be reintegrated once more into the cosmos at large the one becomes many and then the many become one and are increased by one this cyclical pattern repeats itself throughout Cosmic Evolution throughout the history of biological evolution throughout human history throughout individual human lives and throughout successions of individual human lives as this pattern has reiterated itself the cosmos comes ever more closely to approach its ultimate attractor the creation of an individual selfhood which is a particular experiential and intensified man manifestation of the universal transcendental and World generating power which is the logos itself within our Cosmos we can see that the beings which are tasked with the project of actualizing this purpose are human beings and that the focal point of this cosmological drama is the planet Earth as the bandwidth of human Freedom increases through the development of the human self and the refinement of human technological capabilities the human comes to be an Ever more accessible vehicle through which the more pathological forces of our reality might come to instantiate their Wills within our world yet simultaneously the development of human Freedom represents an intensification of our potential to facilitate the rebirth within ourselves of the Inner Light which is the ultimate purposiveness of human existence and the ultimate purposiveness of reality itself academic materialistic ideology would have us believe that we are no more than a contingent product of blind meaningless algorithmic processes of natural selection that we are simply computational software systems operating through gelatinous neurophysiological Hardware that our Earth is but some far-flung rock among innumerable others which was birthed into being by the random fluctuations of broiling astrophysical chaos within scientific Dogma these Notions are encompassed by a more General conception which is often referred to as the capern principle the presumption that we are not unique that our place in the cosmos is not unique this presumption is believed to guard scientific inquiry against the dangers of an theocentric biases biases which are said to arise from our tendency towards overestimating the significance of human existence or even the epistemological Fidelity of the human mind in general if you have followed along with The Narrative of this video and especially if you have followed along with the overall understanding of the world which I have attempted to elucidate through this channel then you will be able to see why I believe that the capern principle itself is a failure to take seriously the centrality of human existence within the journey that is our world accepting the capern principle or any other premises of mechanistic materialism is a refusal to utilize the faculties of human cognition which are actually capable of revealing the inner nature of the world the capern principle is a blindfold and one which has already come to out live its usefulness all separation necessitates the symbiotic reintegration of ever more complex totalities beneath the armonic Labyrinth and beneath the luciferic virtual womb human beings are creating the conditions necessary for the realization of what tahar Des shardan referred to as the noosphere the integration of individual human minds and social system with one another and with the biosphere as a whole such that these separate organisms come to be constitutive organs of the Earth's psychical body jardan tells us that the sphericality of the earth is of atmost significance with regards to this Destiny the spherical nature of the Earth has necessitated that the outward expansive Tendencies of human civilization were destined towards an in full holding of humanity upon itself such that the diversity of human life worlds and form languages have come to encounter and interpenetrate one another this cross-pollination of human form languages is itself of immense significance with regards to the emergence of integral Consciousness which is currently undergoing the initial stages of its embryonic development and the interweaving of human culture is coming to condition the possibility of human social forms which will be harmonized by teleological imperatives rather than simply by homogeneity Conformity coercive exploitation or violence power although the disintegration of human culture forms social structures spiritual Technologies communities and traditions is in many ways a pathological process which is being facilitated by the luciferic and aonic forces which act through the human life world it is simultaneously the case that such breakdown is necessitated by the destiny which human history is ever more rapidly coming to approach it is precisely through such chaos that the human future will come to emerge although it may very well be the case that our world will come to reflect our nightmares of Hell much more mely before it comes to reflect the Inner Light Within the core of our being the task which is presently before us is as simple and as difficult as this it is to disentangle ourselves from the tentacles and Teeth of aramon and Lucifer which threaten to engulf us and to reorient ourselves towards the realization of the future which is calling us forward the challenge we are faced with is a demand upon our ability to imagine as much as it is a demand Upon Our will to achieve we must do the impossible or face the unthinkable as maray bookin once said and the power of faith is if nothing else the power to actualize the impossible

[Music] during the 17th century Renee day cart initiated a radical break from the Western platonic philosophical tradition setting the stage for a distinctly modernist form of Western philosophy and by extension Western culture and politics which has continued to evolve until the present day in numerous ways this postc cartisian mode of philosophy was a radical departure from the spirituality and metaphysics of the Indo-European tradition from which it emerged one of the most significant points of departure within this transformation was the reframing of the fundamental binary between imminence and Transcendence within virtually all traditional Indo European forms of metaphysics the polarity of the imminent and the Transcendent had served as the fundamental axis around which all forms of spirituality cosmology and philosophy were oriented the imminent world was the realm of nature physicality sensation transience particularity and the sense of individual selfhood the realm of the Transcendent conversely was the realm of the Divine and the universal the realm of spirit form Consciousness and the Eternal we can see this primordial division between Earth and Sky Darkness and Light Within essentially all premodern forms of indic neare Eastern and European metaphysics with Renee de cart however this fundamental axis came to shift rather than a cosmology which hinged upon the distinction between the imminent and the Transcendent as such decart's cosmology was one which was centered upon the distinction between mind and matter the natural world came to be conceptualized as consisting of a fundamental substrate which was said to be entirely objective in essence this matter was thus seen to be entirely deterministic and to be entirely devoid of subjectivity agency and animacy on the other side of this division mind also came to be conceptualized in a completely novel way in contrast to the conceptions we find within other metaphysical Frameworks of the Indo-European tradition indic philosophy had tended to conceptualize mind as being fundamentally a kind of transpersonal emptiness which was the unqualified condition for the possibility of the contents of Consciousness which were seen to comprise the world world the platonic tradition on the other hand had tended to conceptualize the mind as being a kind of mediator between the realm of forms and the realm of appearance with deart however mind instead came to be conceptualized primarily as subjectivity as the sense of being a kind of private internal space which is a world which was now seen to be external in contrast to the internality of Consciousness a massive Gulf thus came to open up between the consciousness of the human subject and a world which was now seen to consist primarily of a lifeless inert substrate which was entirely lacking the aliveness which dayart regarded as being exclusive to the human intellect thus was the birth of the metaphysical position which we now know as substance dualism which would eventually set the stage for the development of materialistic monism as physical science and Machine Technologies came to rapidly Advance during the 18th and 19th centuries human beings would increasingly come to see the world in terms of cartisian matter but increasingly Less in terms of cartisian mental substance the intellectual Paradigm would become ever more dominated by physical science which had come to almost entirely amputate itself from its alchemical and hermetic Origins and instead to orient itself in relation to the mechanistic domination of the natural world the epistemological justifications of science would come to be understood almost exclusively in relation to Machine Technologies science was declared to be true because the artifice conducted through science was seen to effectively facilitate the Mastery of nature as such Sciences which attempted to contend with the mental realm came to be seen as suspect any inquiry which was not conducted through the framework of matter was considered to be a malignant vestage of a superstitious past which educated peoples were obligated to anull in pursuit of the enlightenment idea ideals which were said to underly Scientific naturalism many would eventually come to discard the cartisian mental substance entirely and instead came to believe that even the agency subjectivity and animacy of biological organisms including human beings could be understood entirely in terms of purely objective matter that the apparent purposiveness seen in the biological realm could be stood as an epiphenomenal byproduct of entirely blind algorithmic processes and that the human beings inner vistas of experience awareness and Imagination could be revealed as no more than complex patterns performed by electrochemical mechanisms this intellectual project of attempting to recast all animacy as being a complex permutation of mechanic processes would lead modern science and philosophy through an immensely convoluted Maelstrom of attempts to produce a conceptually coherent framework within which the subjective could somehow be derived from the purely objective a project which continues even to the present day although it is becoming increasingly clear to more self-consistent thinkers that this is a circle which simply cannot be square although it is becoming more evident with each passing year that these tides are rapidly changing it is nonetheless the case that our contemporary intellectual landscape still carries with it many vestiges of this materialistic project one of the most pervasive and consequential of such vestiges is the so-called problem of free will when we look to the biological World in general we tend to see living beings of almost any variety as driven by some sort of internal will or agency life seems to strive towards perceived goals and in doing so decisions are made distributions of indeterminate possibility are carved into as it were by organisms which thereby produce the concrete actualities which comprise the past there would thus seem to be a self-d determinacy in nature through which real possibilities come to be actualized real decisions are made which actively select from nebulous clouds of possibility which must be ontologically completed by the agency of decision-making organisms yet if we are to conjecture that all life and mind can in fact be reduced to matter and that matter can be understood as an inert substrate which is driven entirely by deterministic mechanistic and jurdic constants or laws then this would seem to preclude any possibility of any real agency or Freedom machines are not self-determining systems the behavior of A Clockwork mechanism will only seem to be indeterministic if we are ignorant as to how the machine's various components contribute to determining its behaviors the Clockwork only seems to strive towards the achievement of its artificial purpose the device does not make decisions which select from among a variety of possibilities because there are in fact no real possibilities The Machine's behavior is determined by the deterministic processions of its own parts or by external influences or a combin of both in any case the machine cannot be said to be free in any meaningful sense it is a slave to the design of its artificer and to the unyielding constants of the natural order if living organisms are to be understood as complex squishy machines then it might then seem to be that living systems are ultimately just as enslaved by determinism as a clock or steam engine the agency and animacy which we see within living organisms is so some would argue merely an illusion which results from our own ignorance just as we might incorrectly judge A Clockwork mechanism to be making conscious decisions our perception of free decision making within living organisms might very well be an illusion which stems from our own ignorance and epistemologically dubious cognitive predispositions determinists have argued that our perception of agency within biological creatures is due to a kind of epistemological shortcut which our minds employ our senses are incapable of actually perceiving the overwhelming intricacies of living systems our minds are shaped by natural selection so it is said such that our perceptual systems condition our experience of ity in ways that prioritize survival and reproduction and thus in ways that do not necessarily prioritize veracity in relation to the true nature of the world we thereby experience thus it may be that our minds are inclined to perceive biological organisms including other human beings as though these living systems were driven by a self-determined internal agency as this misperception essentially amounts to a kind of efficacious oversimplification a misperception which despite its lack of Correspondence to reality nonetheless serves as an effective pragmatic heuristic our perception of agency in living creatures would therefore be a kind of neurologically pre-programmed illusion evolutionary psychologists of the 20th and 21st centuries came to take this logic even further in arguing that our own felt sense of internal agency is likewise a by product of this adaptive illusion human beings are naturally social creatures throughout the evolutionary history of homo sapiens and even our preh homed forebears our ancestors lived within tribal communities within which a multitude of individuals were required to both cooperate and compete with one another in order to survive an individual homonid would have been required to navigate a highly complex social structure and this social structure was comprised of other hominids who were due to their own evolutionary programming inclined to misperceive one another as driven by an internal agency rather than as complex structures of deterministic biochemical machines in a world in which you are consistently perceived by those around you as an agential being it might therefore be adaptive to perceive oneself as driven by such an internal agency as it might be highly beneficial to be inclined to see oneself in the same way that one is perceived by others thus it has been argued that our perception of conscious agency within ourselves and within other organisms is but a stubbornly persistent illusion and moreover an illusion which we are simply unable to shake due to the fact that this illusion has been hardwired into the very neurophysiological structures of our minds by the blind algorithmic Crucible of natural selection others have gone further still arguing that in fact there is not even a perceptual illusion of Free Will at all and that instead Free Will is merely an artifact of linguistic confusion when we actually examine our behaviors we find that our actions tend to be correlated with certain patterns of mental activity thoughts mental images emotions or impulses determinists argue however that when we are truly attentive to these contents of our Consciousness we find that we have no actual control over their activity thoughts and feelings simply come and go of their own accord and in doing so determine our actions our sense of Free Will thus arises it is said from our tendency to identify ourselves with these contents of our Consciousness to believe that we in fact are these contents rather than the Consciousness Which experiences them as soon as we are able to break this persistent misidentification we realize that there is in fact no longer any illusion of Free Will whatsoever and we come to see that our behavi behaviors are ultimately no different strictly speaking than those of clockwork mechanisms this problem of Free Will is in many ways an acutely modernist problem on the one hand the purported contradiction between Free Will and determinism is only comprehensible within a metaphysical framework which regards nature as fundamentally deterministic in the first place a phenomenon which we simply do not see prior to the cartisian amputation of Mind from matter on the other hand the modernist period is also one in which our understanding of human Freedom itself came to drastically and rapidly evolve both in terms of its consideration within intellectual Frameworks as well as at the deeper level of collective Consciousness more generally specifically our conception of Freedom came to take a distinctly libertine form we came to conceptualize Freedom as a lack of restraint a capacity to choose between a number of options in a way that was in no way compelled by any forces which could be seen as exteral to our Consciousness thus Freedom came to be understood as the liberation of the ego's desires rather than a liberation of the soul from those very desires just as we came to see nature as nothing more than so-called matter we likewise came to substitute the platonic triatic understanding of the human organism with one in which the ego was equivocated with both selfhood and Consciousness as such notice here that this reconceptualization of freedom and selfhood was an elaboration of the cartisian renegotiation of mind and matter mind was conceived as a private internal space while matter and thus nature in general was conceived as the converse of this internality in other words as externality thus it would seem perfectly logical within this framework to regard anything external as restricting the freedom of this cartisian ego in so far as we came to discard the notion of cartisian mental substance we likewise came to see ourselves as comprised of nature as nature had come to be understood as externality this then implied that any and all forces compelling human behavior were by definition external forces which thus precluded the possibility of egoic Freedom notice further that this polarity of internality and external Al ity was itself a reconception of the more primordial polarity of transcendence and imminence the transcendental aspect of human existence and thus of nature was now understood as subjective internality the imminent World therefore came to be understood as the outward expansion of space which we find within the perspectival art forms which came to dominance during the Italian Renaissance just prior to decart's metaphysical inward turn by the 15th century space both internal and external had already presented itself as the next Frontier of human awareness we were then already destining ourselves towards discovering the potency of vacuous emptiness formless potentiality prior to this cartisian perspectival revolution however the transcendental was understood to reside in contrast to particularity and thus in opposition to the individuality of the particular human subject the transcendental was thus understood to be by definition transpersonal but following dayart the particularity of the human individual came to be implicitly understood as the epitome of the transcendental deart had discovered albeit unknowingly the individuality within the human soul and thus the point of interpenetration between the Transcendent and the imminent therefore although deart in many ways laid the groundwork for the Eraser of human Freedom he also quietly laid the groundwork for subsequent developments in the evolution of human Freedom the human ego is the of subjective bodily existence within a given moment of experience it is defined primarily in terms of a felt sense of division between self and world and its primary task as an organ of Consciousness is in maintaining the repetition of our corporeal Constitution it is an organ of repetition which seeks to ensure that the boundaries between self and world between the internal and external remain as they are and are not violated by a world which we feel to be outside of our conscious control bodily existence is characterized primarily by delineation and repetition the body is an intricate structure which is extended through space and time it is a continuity of a given complex of patterns which connect and interweaves the various moments of our physical existence into a holistic Unity the egoic aspects of our being are those which aspire to maintain the repetition of this structure all of our sensorial desires relate to such repetition in some manner or another we desire sustenance because the body requires nutrients and fuel in order to continue perpetuating itself we desire sexual activities because the body must replicate itself in order to maintain this continuity Beyond one's own bodily death we desire wealth and power because these are the means by which the ego feels that it is able to secure and protect itself against the chaotic maelstroms of the external world we desire to satisfy our addictions because the body's compulsion to to repeat often fails to distinguish patterns that are self-destructive from those which are constructive of course these bodily desires needn't be merely egoic as we shall see but within the modernist libertine understanding of Freedom we find an implicit metaphysical presupposition which stands in stark contrast to the metaphysical traditions of virtually all human culture forms namely the identification of the human self with the ego it is thus here that we can see the true nature of the modernist impass between Free Will and determinism if freedom is understood to be the freedom of the ego and the ego is fundamentally an organ of bodily repetition then the human self would indeed appear to be simply pushed and pulled Along by the demands of one's bodily composition within the framework of materialistic reductionism this problem is only Amplified by the conceptual incoherence of materialistic metaphysics within such a deterministic framework holes are understood fundamentally as mere aggregations which are dictated entirely by the blind minations of their parts if you believe that you are your brain and you believe that the behaviors of the brain are determined in a strictly bottom up manner by the lower level substrates that the brain adheres within then it would seem that the brain as a whole essentially contributes nothing in causal terms the causal determinacy is already completed as it were at the lowest level of subatomic interaction events within such reductionistic thought there is nothing left for your Consciousness to actually do as all of the causal work is being performed by the substrate which your body is comprised of your Consciousness then appears to be essentially no more than a mere spectator which is watching your body go through the motions while incessantly falling prey to the illusion that your subjectivity is actually doing anything at all but it is here that we can see the massive and irredeemable inconsistency with within this manner of thinking if the world is understood to be comprised exclusively by matter and matter is understood to be that which determines the world then how can there be such a thing as a subjectivity which contributes no such determination How can there be any room within such a metaphysics for something which is essentially a mere Phantom something which lacks any causal efficacy whatsoever if our sense of subjectivity does not do anything then this implies that it cannot be identified with any of the material constituents of the human organism as those material constituents are defined in terms of what they do the materialistic ideology thus comes to constrict human consciousness until it appears to be a kind of dimensionless point which is entirely untethered from the world in in general thus we can see that when followed through to its logical conclusions such materialism simply reverts back into the cartisian dualism from when it emerged a dualism within which Consciousness is perceived to be a sort of ineffectual and inexplicable ghost within the bodily machine if there is nothing causal which our subjectivity might contribute to the world then why does this subjectiv ity exist at all here there is no recourse even to mythologies of evolutionary Illusions one might argue that our subjective experience of voluntary agency might be an evolutionarily Adaptive misperception but one cannot argue that subjective experience itself is such an Adaptive illusion if one argues that our subjectivity is itself an illusion that was created by natural selection then one must therefore argue that this is an illusion which does in fact have some causal efficacy an ineffectual Phantom cannot be designed by natural selection if there is nothing to select moreover the very notion of subjectivity being an illusion is a deeply confused notion to begin with the very concept of Illusion presupposes subjectivity as an illusion is by definition an experience which is believed to be in congruent with reality by definition one cannot have an illusory experience that one is having experiences we must therefore conclude that our Consciousness is in fact causally efficacious in some way or another and therefore we must ask what exactly is the function of human consciousness in in order to properly address this question we must begin to step outside of both cartisian dualism and materialistic crypto dualism entirely and into the more animistic understanding of reality which is our metaphysical inheritance within platonic metaphysics human selfhood is not equivocated with the human ego rather the human self is understood as a Triad structure which is comprised of logos thymos and EOS mutually interwoven organs of the human self which we can approximately correlate with the terms Soul spirit and ego the archetypal Sun Moon and Earth as we have seen the egoic aspects of human existence are deeply interconnected with the repetition of our bodily composition the Earth beneath our feet is in a sense a linal membrane which divides the present from the past living bodies die and decompose and as they do so they come to be incorporated into the bodily composition of the Earth itself becoming the soil and thus the foundation from which New Life can come to emerge likewise the human ego is a kind of juncture between the immediate present and the immediate past and its desires are fundamentally concerned with the repetition of the past and thus the preservation and perpetuation of our bodily composition Spirit or thymos on the other hand is the lunar aspect of the human self it is the sense in which the human organism is constituted through its interrelatedness with other human beings and with the world in general the Greek thos denotes breath blood and vital Essence it can be understood as the manner in which one's existence is constituted by a metabolism of living forms or forces which interweave us with the world around us just as the moon reflects the light of the Sun the human Spirit reflects the world and is reflected by the world fundamentally Spirit can be stood as the resonant modality of our being the logos noose or solar aspect of the human self then is that which interconnects the human self with the Eternal Celestial realm of forms potentialities and ideals it is the aspect of our being through which we are able to contact and thus to be transformed by transcendental objects the Eternal forms of beauty goodness and Truth within the platonic understanding of the human self it is through this intercourse with the Divine that the human self is able to achieve Liberation from the constraints imposed upon it by the bodily realm as we come to see that the transcendental logos which animates the world is the same as that which is found within the core of the human soul we we can thus come to realize that being determined by that logos is in fact a self-determination in order to understand the full gravity of this interpretation of Freedom we must understand the role of identification within the sense of human selfhood as we have already begun to see there can be an immense degree of ambiguity with regards to what exactly words like self or I should be taken as referring to these words tend to indicate a division between the external and the internal but it is often far from Clear where exactly that division is to be found generally we experience that which is internal to the self as being that which we feel ourselves to have voluntary control over but here we can see that the sense of selfhood is a highly multifaceted phenomenon we feel our own bodies to be within the scope of ourselves under most circumstances yet we generally do not feel that we are voluntarily digesting our food or beating our own hearts these processes seem to lie in a sort of gray area upon the horizons of the self-world boundary but these boundaries are not necessarily fixed some professional athletes use biof feedack back training as a means of learning how to control their own heart rate in a way that most ordinary people cannot through this training a process which was once on the far reaches of the self come to be more thoroughly encompassed by the sense of selfhood something that was once external one's own heart rate is now felt to be at least to a degree internal if we look to the process of human psychological development we see similar processes at work throughout the maturation of the human individual infants must learn to have voluntary control over their basic bodily functions toddlers then learn to feel a sense of control and agency over their behaviors adolescents ideally learn to regulate their own thoughts and emotions every step of the way the sense of selfhood and therefore the sense of Freedom comes to expand encompassing every ever more aspects of our being ever more layers of our composition come to be directed by a central locus of selfhood a center of experiential and volitional gravity which we could call the logos noose higher self or Soul so what then is this Center of self-gravity some would argue of course that this sense of selfhood is in fact merely an illusion produced Ed by the brain but this dismissive pseudo explanation runs ground amidst reiterations of the exact same problems which we find in similar attempts to dismiss subjectivity and volition as mere Illusions simply describing the sense of selfhood as a psychological construct does not explain it way and therefore such descriptions generally do little more than convince us that we have achieved understanding while obscuring the fact that we have not in many ways we can begin to understand this center of gravity as being a sort of inner will after all the expansion of selfhood is an expansion of our experience of volition and as such it seems that the central locus of such experience should itself be characterized by some sort of agency looking yet again to platonism we can see that the notion of will implicates ideal which the will aspires to actualize in general this appears to be the manner in which our sense of volition is seen to operate within a voluntary decision our minds examine a range of possibilities or ideational contents which our minds then evaluate having decided upon a desirable ideation to pursue the aspects of our being which can be commanded by the self are then brought into action in order to realize the possibilities which we are striving towards thus it becomes evident that there is a deep connection between our Center of self-gravity and our capacity for ideational awareness our capacity to cognize potentialities or forms in themselves and thereby select from among them yet this raises yet another question what exactly determines which po potentialities we come to prioritize how exactly do we go about choosing what to Value if we examine our own decision making in specific instances we will find that the answer tends to be a higher value one which is more General more encompassing and of Greater significance than more specific morphologically complex possibilities you might choose a certain career path because it offers a stable income but money is nothing but paper except in relation to the higher ideals which it may facilitate a stable life a family Independence or the ability to engage in more ambitious projects so the question then becomes where does the buck stop is there some ultimate value which all other values and possibilities might be judged in relation to perhaps the highest value which resides at the the core of one's soul is simply imbued within the person by their culture biological predispositions or both if that were indeed the case would that then imply that our sense of volition ultimately amounts to our acting upon behalf of a supreme value which we did not choose would this then imply that we are unfree after all as all of our decisions would still be determined by the external conditions which resulted in our higher self being imbued with a given type of ultimate value but here we should note just how much heavy lifting the word external is performing here a certain late philosopher who I disagree with about almost everything once said if you make yourself small enough you can externalize virtually anything if we see our culture biological composition or even our own sense of ultimate value as being something external then we can indeed convince ourselves that we blacked Freedom after all but then we once again find that the self has vanished Into Obscurity becoming little more than a phantom which floats around between these various allegedly external contributors it is in this sense then that our sense of freedom is also deeply connected to our capacity for commitment in choosing to identify our own selves with a notion of ultimate value we are not only making a moral commitment to such a value but we are also quite literally choosing to become more free in so far as our decisions are guided primarily by a malstrom of factors originating from our environments and the demands of our egos our decisions will fail to be organized in relation to a central locus of self identity on the other hand in so far as we do commit ourselves to a central image of ultimate concern the more that our decisions thoughts and lives come to achieve a harmonious cohesion we will no longer feel our actions and thoughts to be dictated by external forces but rather to be dictated from within by an ultimate value which we feel to be the center of our sense of self Ood and therefore the center of our sense of Freedom here then we can begin to see the way in which the modernist libertine notion of Freedom has actually obfuscated our awareness of our own capacities for Freedom within such a modernist conception freedom is understood as a capacity to choose between various options in an unrestricted uncoerced manner yet now we can begin to see that not all choices are actually free and not all free actions are indeterminate imagine that you are at a pool late at night and there is only one other person there with you a stranger who you have never spoken to before the other person jumps into the water but they don't immediately emerge after a brief moment of confusion you realize that something must be wrong the other person is having a heart attack and will drown if you do not jump in and attempt to rescue resue them those who argue that Free Will is precluded by determinism would argue that your decision to save the drowning person could only be said to be free if you had a real choice that there was a real possibility that you might have chosen not to so let us imagine that we could rewind the universe and replay this scenario numerous times when we do this we see that about half the time you choose to save the other person and the other half of the time you simply watch them drown should we then conclude that this was a truly free decision we can immediately sense intuitively that there seems to be something deeply am Miss in declaring this to be freedom is it really more free in any meaningful sense due to the fact that you very well might have just sat there and watched the other person drown here we should ask within this scenario what factors could possibly be the most relevant in determining the decision to save the other person or not given that the decision would appear to be essentially a random coin flip so perhaps truly indeterministic Quantum fluctuations within your brain were altering your mood just enough in each replay so as to dictate whether you would choose to save the other person or not in this scenario your decision would indeed be a choice between two very real possibilities but can we really call this Freedom can we really say that in this situation you in fact are those Quantum fluctuations which are determining which decision is to be made but now imagine a Converse scenario in which we replay the cosmic tape over and over again and regardless of any and all indeterminate Quantum dice roles you decide to save the person in every single iteration of the scene because you are compelled by a sense of moral obligation to do so determinists would argue that your decision in this scenario cannot be truly free because there was no real possibility at play there was in fact only one possibility your decision was thus not a free choice in the modernist sense but rather a compulsion you had no choice in the matter but if we instead see that very moral compulsion as actually being the core of your selfhood then whether or not this event was deterministic or not seems hardly relevant the outcome was indeed determined but the most relevant determining Factor was an identification with a sense of ultimate value which you actually felt yourself to be as such we can see that often times the most free actions we might make are in fact those in which there was no real choice at all concerning ourselves with whether or not we may have done otherwise should not be interpreted as a question about whether or not things would be different if we replayed the scenario but rather as a question about the role played by our own inner composition in such decisions reductionistic thinking would have us believe that our decisions are determined in a purely bottomup manner that all of our decisions are ultimately determined in advance by the mechanistic interplay of matter in motion but even in an entirely deterministic Universe this would be a dubious assertion as it is one which completely disregards the role of higher order morphologies when we look at a wave moving across a surface of water for example we can see that the individual molecules of water hardly move at all most of their motion is vertical and it is only the form of the wave itself which actually moves along the surface of the water a reductionist might then be inclined to say that this motion is an illusion that there is nothing that actually moves but such a determinist would be hard pressed to maintain that attitude when faced with a tsunami one could argue that the water molecules are in fact the only real determinant of the wave's behavior but we must also recognize that over the course of its lifespan the wave adheres within a completely different aggregation of water molecules from moment to moment as the water molecules themselves do not actually travel with the wave the wave therefore cannot be reduced to a mere aggregation of water molecules it is a hole which is ontologically independent from the constituent components which it adheres within a self-perpetuating form with a causal efficacy that cannot be identified with the causal power of a given collection of molecules likewise it is misleading to claim that biological bodies are constituted primarily by matter living bodies are forms which adhere within a substrate of matter but that does not mean that such bodies can be reduced to that substrate our bodies are like complex knots of various metabolic currents which intersect and diverge within us we consume and excrete inhale and exhale grow and shed we are much like the wave a form which cannot be reduced to a given collection of atoms or molecules as atoms and molecules are incorporated into our bodies they come to be participants in a complex ho which is on logically distinct from such constituents causation therefore must be understood as top down just as much as it is bottom up our bodies push around the atoms within them while the determinacy of the atomic substrate itself serves primarily to provide the foundational stability which is required by more complex and dynamic forms such as waves or bodies moreover the formative composition of living systems consists of many distinct layers which come to be causally nested within one another physiological and metabolic forms instantiate themselves through their adherence within aggregations of molecules behavioral patterns instantiate themselves by animating and directing physiological bodies patterns of thought instantiate themselves by reshaping shaping patterns of behavior at each level a new dimension of causal possibility is unfolded and thus new possibilities of living agency come to emerge yet as we have already noted the nature of human selfhood is itself a dynamic fluid complex which cannot be reduced to any one of these ontological strata the sense of selfhood is rather a complex structure of experience which has evolved and unfolded through the historical evolution of human consciousness a concept which we have already explored extensively in previous videos more specifically what we find in this historical evolution is a trajectory by which the human sense of selfhood has come to ascend through various developmental phases admittedly what I'm about to describe is going to be rather abstract especially if you're new here as I will be condensing ing a very long narrative into a much more brief synopsis so bear with me prior to the late Neolithic period our sense of selfhood was largely localized within the metabolic vital layer of our composition we felt ourselves to reside within our blood and viscera and our sense of selfhood was far more tribal and far less individualistic we remained interwoven with nature Itself by these fluid vital energies which we experienced ourselves fundamentally to be by the time of the early Bronze Age our sense of selfhood had migrated upward into the realm of breath Prana and Puma the animating forms of behavioral patterns drives and impulses yet within this Mythic mode of selfhood our inner voices were not yet experienced as an inner monologue which issues forth from an ideational self rather these inner voices were experienced as the voices of the ancestors who were later identified as the gods our thoughts were yet experienced as something that happened to us and not yet as something that the human self voluntarily enacted over the course of the first axial age the human self would make its way to the throat and mouth and we would begin to identify ourselves with the inner processes of language and ideation we would begin to feel that we were our inner monologues we would begin to see ourselves as distinct personalities as metaphysically independent individuals which could not be reduced to familial tribal or national affinities the Mind itself came to be understood as more fundamental to the composition of the human organism them relations of blood and kinship during the Italian Renaissance the self would migrate into the interior of the human skull the human self would be experienced as an inner Observer who looked outward unto the world through the eyes as the self came to be identified with the Interior Space of subjectivity itself rather than simply the ideational contents which were manifested within that Inner Space within the world of art this subjectification of the human self would come to manifest as perspectivity within which the viewer's subjective reference frame came to be incorporated as an integral aspect of artistic forms themselves as this process has unfolded the self has come to Encompass ever more layers of our ontological makeup and the human individual has become ever more autonomous through this Collective individuation we have become far less collectivistic and far more individualized our sense of selfhood has contracted so as to become a singularity of individual subjectivity while our inner worlds have expanded so as to create vast encompassing caverns of personal experience with the unfolding of our inner Worlds the space of possibilities available to the individual human subject has likewise come to expand the dark cavernous worlds of experience which have grown within us are now wombs from which the light of logos may come to be born within which our wings might have the space to unfurl the sun is the archetypal representative of ultimate value but also the representative of the will which is drawn forward by such an ultimate aim it is the soul but also the self which the soul comes to manifest through its Journey it is the center and the circumference of the human organism as Carl Yung once said just as this inner logos comes to generate human individuality the cosmic logos comes to generate the world and the two processes are intimately interwoven with one another the cosmos is the engine of creativity which produces unfathomable multiplicities which are then integrated so as to form living fractals of symbiotic Unity it is through this process that the cosmos achieves its aim the experience of beauty an improvisational dance of Order and Chaos Agony and Bliss gravitation and Radiance separation and return this Cosmic logos is thus a will towards the actualization of numinosity a creativity which strives towards ultimate experiential intensification of Harmony towards the interweaving of the many into Oneness primordial Cosmic Consciousness is characterized by ultimate creative freedom ultimate acceptance of otherness and ultimate wholeness as such the ultimate realization of experiential intensity is in manifesting the qualities of primordial Oneness within the particularity of individual subjectivity the logos is therefore both the ultimate aim or Telos of the human soul as well as the human soul itself ultimate Freedom therefore lies and the realization that the logos within us is in fact both the beating heart of our own existence as well as the heart of the cosmos as such and in the realization that the ultimate aim of that logos is its Incarnation within the human individual through the metamorphosis of the human self the achievement of theosis the selves which our souls have been meticulously constructing over the course of history as well as our own individual lives are the conditions for the possibility of such Freedom a freedom which is in fact an identification between the human will and Cosmic purposiveness within such Freedom there is indeed self-d determinacy and therefore indeterminacy there is indeed the necessitation of individuality and thus the liberation of the individual from the constraints which are imposed upon it yet this is much more than a liberation of the ego's desires for repetition and self-securing it is a Liberation by which the human person is able to realize its own individuality through the realization that the innermost purpose of such individuality the innermost core of One's Own selfhood lies in the individual's capacity to contribute itself to a narrative which transcends and overcomes the separation of individual existence freedom is not a power which we are granted by def fault nor is it a power which can be realized through the mere Liberation from constraint it is a power which must be germinated within us through a descent into the innermost fathoms of our being it is only within that endless expanse of formless obliterating Darkness that we find the point of Light which is in fact the center of our lives and in fact the center of our universe thanks for watching

# Implicate Morphogenic Potentiality

From the depths of nothingness, a spark ignites. In the vast emptiness of non-being, a flicker of possibility emerges. How can something arise from nothing? This question has perplexed philosophers, scientists and mystics for millennia.

The notion of absolute nothingness - a void devoid of space, time, energy or even potential - seems to preclude the possibility of anything coming into existence. And yet, here we are, inhabitants of a rich and complex universe teeming with matter, energy, and conscious experience. Our very existence seems to defy the axiom that out of nothing, nothing comes.

But what if nothingness itself contained the seeds of being? What if, paradoxically, absolute emptiness was pregnant with infinite potential? To explore this mind-bending possibility, we must venture beyond our everyday intuitions and linear logic. We must peer into the nature of reality at its most fundamental level, at the boundary between existence and non-existence.

Really, what else does existence even mean? For a thing to exist is for there to be a distinction between what it is and what it is not. TODO: give some simple examples of this. Then discuss how life must continually reassert its own existence by sharpening its definition against the forces of decay. Connect this concept to entropy and self-organization from nonexistence.

Other points i want to make:

This has profound implications for mathematicians and logicians. Because mathematicians and logicians often build their formali systems from arbitrarily chosen rules called "axioms" that attempt to create a logical framework for deriving new statements from known ones. However the choice of axioms is arbitrary and has rightly been criticized for allowing for implicating arbitrary results or even the creation of inconsistent or "paradoxical" systems. But this theory of morphogenic potentiality derives from the most tautologically fundamental foundations possible.
